    <thetext>I am not sure if the right component for this is gnome-shell, please change to the appropriate one if not.

For years I have been chasing after each update that removed context menu and button icons, locating the hidden option that changed location a couple of times to re-enable them. After installing most of the packages listed in FEDORA-2016-5522a26f9b, the menu icons have once again disappeared from every application. I can understand and I can live with gnome-* having a simple &quot;uncluttered&quot; interface, but users don&apos;t just install GNOME for the sake of having GNOME.

* In LibreOffice it takes A LOT of time trying to identify the option one needs without menu icons and the user ends up memorizing paths through menus and submenus, only to painstakingly hunt again for the right choice when they eventually forget them. This is seriously counter-productive.

* In Firefox, it is now impossible to distinguish between folders, smart bookmarks and feeds. Also, I have several thousand bookmarks, organized in multiple nested folders. Where appropriate, some of them are alphabetized, which means that folders are mixed with web pages when on the same level. When some pages lack a favicon and their names are long enough, it&apos;s just impossible to tell folders and pages apart.

And these are just a couple of examples of programs that I happen to use frequently. I can&apos;t fathom that anyone actually believes that looking e.g. for the word &quot;Cut&quot; through a bunch of other strings of text gets the job done more quickly than locating a pair of scissors.

There is currently an open upstream bug, worded as a RFE:
https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=760743

As you can see, it has gone unanswered for nearly a year and I can remember reading other bug reports years ago, when the &quot;feature&quot; was first introduced, which were met with hostility.

Please revert this change - just downstream, if necessary.</thetext>

    <thetext>Not really sure if it was gtk, because recent 3.22.x versions don&apos;t mention anything relevant. I got the folder icons back after updating to firefox-52.0-1, 
mutter-3.22.3-1 and vala-0.34.6-1, however there was no mention of this issue either in the upstream changelogs or those of the corresponding fedora packages. These are all the packages that got updated in that transaction:
