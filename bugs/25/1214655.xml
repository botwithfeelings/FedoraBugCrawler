    <thetext>Fedora 22 Beta installed using qemu like this:

I then installed all current updates with

    “sudo dnf update”

Then logged into Gnome Wayland.

When marking a text with the mouse, it is not yet in the cut&amp;paste
buffer, pasting with the middle mouse button does not yet work.

But when typing Control-c (Shift-Control-c in gnome-terminal) after
marking text with the mouse, it is in the cut&amp;paste buffer and can be
pasted with the middle mouse button (or Control-v (Shift-Control-v in
Gnome-terminal). Same behaviour in gnome-terminal, gedit and
apparently all other Gnome stuff.

In the non-Wayland Gnome session, marking the text with the mouse
is enough to put it in the cut&amp;paste buffer and then paste it with
the middle mouse button.</thetext>

no Control-c is needed.</thetext>

    <thetext>On the final Fedora 22 release, it seems even worse:
Pasting from gedit into gnome-terminal works, but pasting from gnome-terminal
into gedit does not really work: Sometimes the pasted text appears with 30 seconds
delay in gedit, sometimes not at all.</thetext>

Between Gnome/Wayland programs it is sometimes working, sometimes not,
see comment#4 which describes problems pasting from gnome-terminal to gedit.

Between Gnome/Wayland and X11/Gtk2 programs it never works, that is bug:

Wouldn’t it be possible to make the clipboard work not only with C-c, C-v but
also with the mouse?</thetext>

    <thetext>I tried it myself and both using the mouse and crtl+c on Firefox AND then shift+ctrl+v on Gnome Terminal does NOT work. 

On the other hand copying a pasting from Gedit to Gnome Terminal does work.

But you can&apos;t copy from Firefox to gedit.</thetext>

That would cause the clipboard content to be replaced any time someone selects any text without even explicitly invoking a copy, that&apos;d be quite confusing to most users imho.</thetext>

Not confusing at all. It worked like that on Linux for ages.</thetext>

&gt; Not confusing at all. It worked like that on Linux for ages.

No, it&apos;s not so simple unfortunately, on X11 (Linux has nothing to do with this) you have multiple clipboards, &quot;primary&quot;, &quot;secondary&quot; and &quot;clipboard&quot; so just selecting with the left mouse button will not override nor clear your clipboard buffer - That&apos;s two different buffers.

See jwz&apos;s description here for a description on how this works: https://www.jwz.org/doc/x-cut-and-paste.html

On Wayland, for now, there is only one buffer, so if you override its content whenever you select something, it will be utterly confusing and will not be the same as what you have now on X11, this is what I was trying to explain in my comment 12.

Either we&apos;d need to add a new separate buffer in Wayland to be able to do the same as X11, or we&apos;d need to come up with a slightly different approach to copy the selection to the buffer (but then it wouldn&apos;t be the exact same thing as X11 (but do we really want Wayland to be exactly the same as X11?).</thetext>

How about adding an option to Wayland that would allow to override the buffer whenever you select/mark something with the mouse. It could be disabled by default but that way it can be enable by people that explicitly like this behaviour. No harm done to everyone else.
 
&gt; Either we&apos;d need to add a new separate buffer in Wayland to be able to do
&gt; the same as X11, or we&apos;d need to come up with a slightly different approach
&gt; to copy the selection to the buffer (but then it wouldn&apos;t be the exact same
&gt; thing as X11 (but do we really want Wayland to be exactly the same as X11?).

No, please don&apos;t add another buffer. All the different buffers made X11 behaviour very confusing. Instead let people configure how they want their copy/paste buffer to behave.
I don&apos;t think there is &quot;the solution&quot; to the problem but giving people the possibility to configure their environment and start-out with a basic (sane) configuration for most users sounds like a good way to me.

Thanks for considering!</thetext>

    <thetext>well,

i you have to execute a tons of commands taken from a text file 
ot executin some web-based tutorial

just select it and middle-click

if you want to review before execution do not select eol, otherwise
select a middle-click run it


Having to rely on clipboard for this is just M$-Windows way of doing things.

Next step would be replace bash with CMD.EXE 


Strongly disagree

I&apos;ll remain with X until FIXED</thetext>

    <thetext>ok 

Keep calm 

It&apos;s a bug, 
not a feature!

X PRIMARY works outside Gnome/GTK3

Without Wayland, Gnome/GTK3 support middle-click selection paste 

There is e &quot;Gnome-Tweak&quot; to enable &quot;legacy&quot; middle-paste
it works without interfering with clipboard, as usual

It look like a Wayland/GTK3 integration issue

(the were some strange new in the past about 
Gnome/Wayland removing support for X-SELECTION

I do not know internals, 
maybe X-SELECTION is supported only in X compatilibity layer
or it is &quot;just&quot; a bug.

I hope for the second choice.


In LibreOffice 5.0.3.2- Arch Linux it works but maybe it is because now is running under GTK2 not GTK3</thetext>

&gt; &quot;Let people configure it&quot; is almost never the right solution.

Exactly the same as &quot;Sloppy-Focus/Click-to-Focus&quot;

In fact, X selection &quot;requires&quot; sloppy-focus ...</thetext>

    <thetext>NO Hope?

XWayland only

so xterm/terminator instead of gnome-terminal
Emacs forever! 

Problems will start when firefox will switch to gtk3

https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=627699

LibreOffice too (now still in gtk2)



X-SELECTION is &quot;eco-sustainable&quot;, CLIPBOARD is NOT (How many CO2 caused ?)

X-SELECTION do not harm your hands, CLIPBOARD cause damages (carpal tunnel syndrome)

What about &quot;Accessibility&quot; ?

Not as default, but as a &quot;hidden&gt;&quot; option (like Caps Locks re-mapping)</thetext>

    <thetext>Lots of people with a long Unix/Linux history under X are using
cut/paste via mouse selection/middle mouse click for ages.  Personally
I&apos;m used to this feature for at least 15 years.  If you remove this -
very essential - feature, you&apos;re going to cripple productivity of a
lot of people for no good reason.  It would be definitely a reason to
ignore Wayland and to stay on X as long as possible.

From my POV this feature needs to be retained to make Wayland usable.
I fully agree with Mike, Stefan and Giovanni.  Let people decide how
to use this by themselves, please, and don&apos;t kill old, and thus *used*
X11 features just because they seem to be &quot;old&quot;.

One copy/paste buffer is enough, though.  Either people use the copy
mouse selection feature or not.  If they do, they know what they are
doing.  Really.

    <thetext>Also is there an API in wayland to &apos;hook&apos; on when the clipboard buffer changes ?

There are many &quot;clipboard managers&quot; for X that I find quite handy, along with mouse selection (they&apos;re sometimes a bit kludgy trying to synchronise all the different buffs though, but we won&apos;t have the problem with a single buffer and I definitely think we need to keep that way)

Said clipboard managers could allow for easy configuration of use mouse selection copy or not, too.</thetext>

    <thetext>it&apos;s dumb, stupid... every laptop I buy I make sure it has a track point and tree-buttons pad. I can only wonder what hardware dev guys themselves use.
New Gnome is so smart, resizing, moving windows with a KEY + buttons. Scrolling contents with mid-button + track point even without switching(moving focus) to the window, including gnome-terminal - all this still works in Wayland, only that select-copy-paste mid-button got wasted... why??... ough..</thetext>
