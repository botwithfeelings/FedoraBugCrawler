    <thetext>Description of problem:
The systemd service script for gnokii-smsd does not read additional arguments from /etc/sysconf/gnokii-smsd. Moreover, this later file must be adapted for systemd processing.
This bug prevents using gnokii-smsd with a database backend.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
gnokii-smsd-0.6.31-7.fc20.x86_64

Additional info:
For example, the gnokii-smsd.service file should be updated as:
..............
Environment=&quot;SMSD_OPTS=&quot;
EnvironmentFile=-/etc/sysconfig/gnokii-smsd
ExecStart=/usr/bin/gnokii-smsd $SMSD_OPTS
..............

And the /etc/sysconfig/gnokii-smsd should be adapted to include the log option in SMSD_OPTS.</thetext>

    <thetext>This message is a reminder that Fedora 20 is nearing its end of life.
Approximately 4 (four) weeks from now Fedora will stop maintaining
and issuing updates for Fedora 20. It is Fedora&apos;s policy to close all
bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time
this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora  &apos;version&apos;
of &apos;20&apos;.

Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you
plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the &apos;version&apos; 
to a later Fedora version.

Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not 
able to fix it before Fedora 20 is end of life. If you would still like 
to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version 
of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the &apos;version&apos; to a later Fedora 
version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.

Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release&apos;s 
lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a 
more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes 
bugs or makes them obsolete.</thetext>

    <thetext>This bug appears to have been reported against &apos;rawhide&apos; during the Fedora 23 development cycle.
Changing version to &apos;23&apos;.

(As we did not run this process for some time, it could affect also pre-Fedora 23 development
cycle bugs. We are very sorry. It will help us with cleanup during Fedora 23 End Of Life. Thank you.)

    <thetext>F23 --&gt; F25.

This is an old report &gt; 2 years.
A suggestion fix is listed in the initial description.
However nothing has been done yet.
At least a comment from the maintainer would be appreciated...</thetext>
