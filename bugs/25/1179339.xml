    <thetext>Please convert this application to use the system&apos;s crypto policy for SSL and TLS:
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:CryptoPolicies

If this program is compiled against gnutls, change the default priority string to be &quot;@SYSTEM&quot; or to use gnutls_set_default_priority().

If this program is compiled against openssl, and there is no default cipher list specified, you don&apos;t need to modify it. Otherwise replace the default cipher list with &quot;PROFILE=SYSTEM&quot;.

In both cases please verify that the application uses the system&apos;s crypto policies.

If the package is already using the system-wide crypto policies, or it does not use SSL or TLS, no action is required, the bug can simply be closed.</thetext>

    <thetext>This message is a reminder that Fedora 21 is nearing its end of life.
Approximately 4 (four) weeks from now Fedora will stop maintaining
and issuing updates for Fedora 21. It is Fedora&apos;s policy to close all
bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time
this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora  &apos;version&apos;
of &apos;21&apos;.

Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you
plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the &apos;version&apos; 
to a later Fedora version.

Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not 
able to fix it before Fedora 21 is end of life. If you would still like 
to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version 
of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the &apos;version&apos; to a later Fedora 
version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.

Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release&apos;s 
lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a 
more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes 
bugs or makes them obsolete.</thetext>

    <thetext>Checked rsyslog on rawhide, it is using GnuTLS and from searching trough package contents it seems to adhere to system-wide crypto-policies: uses &quot;gnutls_set_default_priority(session)&quot;</thetext>
