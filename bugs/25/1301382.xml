    <thetext>Description of problem:
I have my default browser set to Seamonkey in KDE, but when I click on links in Terminator they open in Firefox. xdg-open does do the right thing, so I suspect that Terminator is using some other setting to determine which browser to use.

I am unsure if this would be a packaging issue, or an issue with upstream. If you believe it to be an upstream issue, say the word and I will file it there and link here for you.</thetext>

    <thetext>This message is a reminder that Fedora 23 is nearing its end of life.
Approximately 4 (four) weeks from now Fedora will stop maintaining
and issuing updates for Fedora 23. It is Fedora&apos;s policy to close all
bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time
this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora  &apos;version&apos;
of &apos;23&apos;.

Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you
plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the &apos;version&apos; 
to a later Fedora version.

Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not 
able to fix it before Fedora 23 is end of life. If you would still like 
to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version 
of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the &apos;version&apos; to a later Fedora 
version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.

Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release&apos;s 
lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a 
more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes 
bugs or makes them obsolete.</thetext>

    <thetext>This bug is still present in stock F25 and even the GTK3 branch of Terminator. I think it affects all GTK applications.

Here is a work around: open gnome-control-center, then go to the Details panel and changing the default application for Web. Note that xdg-open honors the default browser chosen in KDE because it reads ~/.config/mimeapps.list. Perhaps GTK could be fixed to do the same when Gnome isn&apos;t running?

if you agree that this is not a Terminator-specific bug, please reassign this to GTK (or file a new bug).</thetext>
