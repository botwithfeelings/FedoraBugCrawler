    <thetext>Hi, help please.

I got this problem all the time since F24, (now on F25) on various laptops.

-------------

Description:
*Something* happens.

Then some parts of the cinnamon starts to be unresponsive.
Mainly the &quot;screen brightness up/down&quot; buttons. Then the lock screen. Then even &quot;su&quot; command!
What&apos;s more, the time, when it is unresponsive grows over time!
First, it can be second, or two ... or ten. Then minutes.

The real problem is, that you, for example, set &quot;brightness up&quot;.
But nothing happens. For a minute. You want to walk of your laptop, so you want to lock it, but you can&apos;t because it is unresponsive. So you sit down and use a keaboard shortcut to open file manager and terminal. But they are frozen too.
So you click on the terminal icon, and want to restart your computer. You enter &quot;su&quot;. But well ... it freeze for a while too.

It is really annoying andit can occur few times a day in a scale I have to force restart the laptop.

-------------

I haven&apos;t ever found any hint, what could cause it, however, I experience it more often, when I put the machine to sleep mode and wake it up a few times. (wich is my basic usecase through a day)



Don&apos;t hesistate to &quot;needinfo&quot; me on everything you would need.</thetext>

    <thetext>Thanks for investigation.

I installed the package from Bodhi updates, however, my feedback can be delayed, since I have no idea, what cause this bug.</thetext>

    <thetext>As i mentioned in the Bodhi, this update ^ did not solved the issue.

However, I have more information:

When it happens, it breaks mounting.
Whatever you pick - USB flash drive, external HDD or SD card, it can&apos;t be mounter with error message &quot;Not authorized to perform this operation&quot;.

I checked &quot;dmesg&quot;, seems alright.
I checked &quot;journalctl -xe&quot;, but I don&apos;t know, what to look for.

for example (?):
&quot;Ãºno 22 00:24:02 my-ntb python3[15165]: detected unhandled Python exception in &apos;/usr/share/cinnamon-screensaver/cinnamon-screensaver-command.py&apos;
&quot;


Give me some suggestions where to look and for what, and I&apos;ll try to catch the cause or make some reproducer.</thetext>

    <thetext>Unfortunatelly, I&apos;m still strucked with this issue :/
But hey, I have some new info!

Recently, I ran &apos;dnf upgrade&apos;, which, after some research showed, I must have somehow damaged systemd.
Systemd scripts are looping infinitely, deamons fails to restart and so on ...

I believe, this could be the cause of delays and freezes.


Now the bad news:
I fight with this bug daily since F24, for more than half a year. I re-installed Fedora dozens times, without MAJOR configuration (of course, I install my beloved programs and stuff for work and configure the environment, but I never touched &apos;deep&apos; settings of the system)


I&apos;ll leave this bug report closed for now, and I&apos;ll start to solve this with systemd guys.</thetext>
