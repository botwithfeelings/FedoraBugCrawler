    <thetext>Description of problem:

The strings in hexadecimal search work differently than described in the docs.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):

mc-4.8.14-2

How reproducible:

Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. echo thisisatest &gt;test.txt
2. open test.txt in internal viewer in hexadecimal mode
3. search for a string &quot;this&quot; using hexadecimal mode
4. now search for a string &quot;thi&quot; 0x73

Actual results:

In the first case the string was cut by omitting the last character.
In the second case the string was not found.

Expected results:

It should find both strings according to docs.

    <thetext>This message is a reminder that Fedora 23 is nearing its end of life.
Approximately 4 (four) weeks from now Fedora will stop maintaining
and issuing updates for Fedora 23. It is Fedora&apos;s policy to close all
bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time
this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora  &apos;version&apos;
of &apos;23&apos;.

Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you
plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the &apos;version&apos; 
to a later Fedora version.

Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not 
able to fix it before Fedora 23 is end of life. If you would still like 
to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version 
of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the &apos;version&apos; to a later Fedora 
version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.

Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release&apos;s 
lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a 
more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes 
bugs or makes them obsolete.</thetext>
