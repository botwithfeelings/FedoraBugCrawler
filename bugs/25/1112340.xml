    <thetext>Description of problem:
Rejected recipients are not passed to a milter requesting them using the SMFIP_RCPT_REJ option.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
sendmail-8.14.8-2.fc20.x86_64

How reproducible:
Always

Actual results:
Only accepted recipients are passed to the milter.

Expected results:
Milter notified of all recipients.


Additional info:
To enable this option, an additional sendmail compilation switch must be passed:
In the sendmail.spec file, append:
        -D_FFR_MILTER_CHECK_REJECTIONS_TOO
to the definition list of line:
define(\`confENVDEF&apos;, \`-I%{_includedir}/libdb -I/usr/kerberos/include ...

This should resolve the problem.</thetext>

    <thetext>This message is a reminder that Fedora 20 is nearing its end of life.
Approximately 4 (four) weeks from now Fedora will stop maintaining
and issuing updates for Fedora 20. It is Fedora&apos;s policy to close all
bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time
this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora  &apos;version&apos;
of &apos;20&apos;.

Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you
plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the &apos;version&apos; 
to a later Fedora version.

Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not 
able to fix it before Fedora 20 is end of life. If you would still like 
to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version 
of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the &apos;version&apos; to a later Fedora 
version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.

Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release&apos;s 
lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a 
more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes 
bugs or makes them obsolete.</thetext>

    <thetext>This bug appears to have been reported against &apos;rawhide&apos; during the Fedora 23 development cycle.
Changing version to &apos;23&apos;.

(As we did not run this process for some time, it could affect also pre-Fedora 23 development
cycle bugs. We are very sorry. It will help us with cleanup during Fedora 23 End Of Life. Thank you.)

    <thetext>F23 --&gt; F25.

This is an old report &gt; 2 years.
The fix is listed in the initial description.
However nothing has been done yet.
This bug prevents fuzzy recipient address matching milters to do their jobs.
At least a comment from the maintainer would be appreciated...</thetext>

    <thetext>I&apos;m sorry this is taking so long. Currently this is held by [1] - sendmail fails to build in Rawhide, so we can&apos;t really do any updates for it. I&apos;ll look into fixing this as soon as I can.
