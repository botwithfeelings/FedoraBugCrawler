<thetext>Hi, it caches metadata. You see the checking if metadata are up-to-date. You can set different metadata expire policy by `metadata_expire` option in each repo config file (etc/yum.repos.d/*.repo) or wait for bug 850896 to be implemented.</thetext>

<thetext>metadata_expire is set to 0 which works fine in yum. Higher values cause too large latencies and fetching the small repomd.xml (&lt; 10KiB) does not matter. Using other protocols for metadata download (as discussed in 850896) is an
orthogonal problem which deals with downloading *new* metadata.</thetext>

<thetext>IMO all metadata and even repomd.xml should be requested with header If-Modified-Since. See section 14.25 of: http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html When correctly implemented and files are not modified, then only HTTP
headers are transfered and no real data.</thetext>

<thetext>It appears to me that DNF uses metadata_expire entirely differently than yum. Please read the following quote from &quot;man yum.conf&quot;: === metadata_expire Time (in seconds) after which the metadata will expire. So that if the current
metadata downloaded is less than this many seconds old then yum will not update the metadata against the repository. If you find that yum is not downloading information on updates as often as you would like lower the value of this option.
(...truncated...) The default is 6 hours, to compliment yum-updatesd running once an hour. === Again: &quot;So that if the current metadata downloaded is less than this many seconds old then yum will not update the metadata against the
repository.&quot; This IMHO means that yum uses metadata_expire to avoid excessively frequent downloading of metadata. Once fresh metadata are downloaded, yum does not download metadata from the repository, even when newer metadata are possibly
available in the repository. Once the metadata_expire time interval expires, yum absolutely does not force the metadata re-downloading for no reason, e.g. if there are no newer metadata available in the repo. In contrast, dnf IMHO uses
metadata_expire in such a way that it really expires the local copy of metadata by declaring them as outdated and unconditionally (and possibly for no practical reason, if the local copy of the metadata still matches the repo metadata) causes the
unchanged metadata to be redownload again and againg, with really strange and annoying result like Fedora 23 - i386 898 kB/s | 39 MB 00:45 If there is only small number of small .drpms to be downloaded, the ~40MB size of unnecessary re-download of
just this Fedore release repo is frequently multiple of the size of .drpms to be downloaded. Provided you are connected through 8Mbit ADSL line, it took 45 seconds in this example. If there is possibly FUP omn your line, you have lost not only the
time, but also megabytes from yout FUP limit. Taken into account how long this issue is reported and discussed again and again, you should definitely to fix this, I hate to say ASAP, but I say really soon. (Koukejte, chlapi v Brne, neco s tim konecne
udelat. Jak to je ted, je to skutecne rozcilujici, otravne, zere to cas, megabajty... A snad nemuze byt zas az tak tezke to nejak spravit.) Brgds, Eduard</thetext>

<thetext>Fedora 22 changed to end-of-life (EOL) status on 2016-07-19. Fedora 22 is no longer maintained, which means that it will not receive any further security or bug fix updates. As a result we are closing this bug. If you can reproduce this bug
against a currently maintained version of Fedora please feel free to reopen this bug against that version. If you are unable to reopen this bug, please file a new report against the current release. If you experience problems, please add a comment to
this bug. Thank you for reporting this bug and we are sorry it could not be fixed.</thetext>

<thetext>Hello. In my opinion, this is one of the most annoying bugs during some past years. Please just put your Fedora systems behing some 8, 4 or 2Mbit DSL line and you will see what I am talking about. Sometimes, if there are only few small DRPMs
in the update set, the metadata are much bigger than updates to be downloaded. Please read my comment #6 in this BZ entry and *fix*this*bug*. Thanks in advance, Eduard</thetext>

<thetext>Hi Jaroslav. Once I ugrade to nightly build of dnf-2.3 on F25, will it be downgradeable back to the current F25 dnf version via &quot;dnf distro-sync&quot; ? E.g., databases backward compatility and similar things? I would like to help with
testing, but I have to try on physical computer and do not wish to wait some two months for F26 with nightly build of dnf installed. Thanks, Eduard</thetext>

<thetext>Just tried &quot;what will happen if I try to upgrade dnf t version 2... dnf copr enable rpmsoftwaremanagement/dnf-nightly dnf update offers skipping about three fullscreens of dnf-2 packages and the suggested dnf update -- best
--allowerasing is only slightly better with offer of installing/upgrading/replacing lots of packages, but also Skipping packages with broken dependencies: dnf src 2.4.0-0.28ge949aaa.fc25 rpmsoftwaremanagement-dnf-nightly 552 k dnf-plugins-core src
2.0.0-0.30gb26c810.fc25 rpmsoftwaremanagement-dnf-nightly 128 k dnf-plugins-extras src 2.0.0-0.24gc320b3a.fc25 rpmsoftwaremanagement-dnf-nightly 76 k Transaction Summary ================================================================================
Install 11 Packages Upgrade 23 Packages Remove 9 Packages Skip 3 Packages Total download size: 3.0 M It does not look OK to me to proceed, so for now I did dnf copr disable rpmsoftwaremanagement/dnf-nightly and I am ready to give it another try in
the future. These three src packages are only sources not needed for dnf-2.3 operation? Your advice pls? Please note that the above happened on physical computer with up-to-date 32bit F25 installed. [vopicka@localhost tmp]$ rpm -qa|grep ^dnf|sort

<thetext>Thanks for your try. Skipped packages src - this is bug in dnf-1.1.x . This packages are uninstallable because they contain source code. With dnf-2.3 you will not see them and dnf will not try to install them. How to downgrade dnf-2.3 to
dnf-1.1: Just do &quot;dnf downgrade dnf-1.1*&quot;. Or may be + --allowerasing. What could happen with downgrade: Probably some of plugins could be removed, but then you can install them back (depends on installed plugins). What is incompatible in
Fedora25 with dnf-2.3: yumex-dnf anaconda Personally I did downgrade dnf-2.X to dnf-1.1 many times for testing purposes, but only I experience removal of plugins (the packages were renamed, therefore obsoletes were used. But obsoletes cannot handle
downgrades to restore original situation). Thanks a lot for your cooperation.</thetext>
