tripwire.cron.in patch to send email and produce no cron output on normal run

Description of problem:
cron.daily/tripwire-check does not correctly send mail to the mail recipient in twcfg.txt

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
tripwire-2.4.2.2-1.fc17

How reproducible:
Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set GLOBALEMAIL to email address to receive error reports
2. Rebuild configuration (twadmin -m F twcfg.txt)
3. Run the cron in cron.daily/tripwire-check
  
Actual results:
Errors/output are send to stdout (and therefore the default cron email recipient)

Expected results:
Errors should be send to the GLOBALEMAIL recipient in twcfg.txt

Additional info:
A simple fix is to add --email-report (or -M) to the tripwire command.  A better solution is to suppress cron output and only send error reports to the intended recipient as follows:

tripwire --check --email-report --silent --no-tty-output

I&apos;ve added a patch that does the above.</thetext>

    <thetext>This message is a reminder that Fedora 17 is nearing its end of life.
Approximately 4 (four) weeks from now Fedora will stop maintaining
and issuing updates for Fedora 17. It is Fedora&apos;s policy to close all
bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time
this bug will be closed as WONTFIX if it remains open with a Fedora 
&apos;version&apos; of &apos;17&apos;.

Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you
plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the &apos;version&apos; 
to a later Fedora version prior to Fedora 17&apos;s end of life.

Bug Reporter:  Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that 
we may not be able to fix it before Fedora 17 is end of life. If you 
would still like  to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it 
against a later version  of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 
&apos;version&apos; to a later Fedora version prior to Fedora 17&apos;s end of life.

Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release&apos;s 
lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a

    <thetext>Fedora 20 changed to end-of-life (EOL) status on 2015-06-23. Fedora 20 is
no longer maintained, which means that it will not receive any further
security or bug fix updates. As a result we are closing this bug.

If you can reproduce this bug against a currently maintained version of
Fedora please feel free to reopen this bug against that version. If you
are unable to reopen this bug, please file a new report against the
current release. If you experience problems, please add a comment to this
bug.

    <thetext>The parameter GLOBALEMAIL is not set by default into tw.cfg file and with your patch, email was not sent anyway (this behaviour is not wanted).
With email-report option only (without silent and no-tty-output options), email is sent twice (one by cron and one by tripwire)

It&apos;s not shocking to have to modify cron line if config file was modified.</thetext>

    <thetext>Thanks for responding Didier :)

The problem here is that if I have GLOBALEMAIL set in config (not replaced during upgarde), I still have to re-edit the cron line every time the package is upgraded to receive the email.  I&apos;ve repeatedly missed this step when tripwire upgrades are lost in the occasional mass upgrade Fedora seems to get...

The cron email (default, w/o --silent) is sent every day, and so tripwire warnings are easily lost in the daily cron noise (and would involve filtering to recognize when it should be escalated)

The --email-report option can be controlled by EMAILREPORTLEVEL, and so can be selective.

I could easily update the patch so that it uses twadmin --print-cfgfile to check if GLOBALEMAIL is set, and use the --email-report in this case, and the default (non-silent) otherwise; that would keep the current behavior unless the user has explicitly requested the --email-report behavior.  Would that work?

Let me know.</thetext>
