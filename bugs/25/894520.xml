    <thetext>This message is a reminder that Fedora 18 is nearing its end of life.
Approximately 4 (four) weeks from now Fedora will stop maintaining
and issuing updates for Fedora 18. It is Fedora&apos;s policy to close all
bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time
this bug will be closed as WONTFIX if it remains open with a Fedora 
&apos;version&apos; of &apos;18&apos;.

Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you
plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the &apos;version&apos; 
to a later Fedora version prior to Fedora 18&apos;s end of life.

Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we may not be 
able to fix it before Fedora 18 is end of life. If you would still like 
to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version 
of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the &apos;version&apos; to a later Fedora 
version prior to Fedora 18&apos;s end of life.

Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release&apos;s 
lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a 
more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes 
bugs or makes them obsolete.</thetext>

    <thetext>This bug appears to have been reported against &apos;rawhide&apos; during the Fedora 23 development cycle.
Changing version to &apos;23&apos;.

(As we did not run this process for some time, it could affect also pre-Fedora 23 development
cycle bugs. We are very sorry. It will help us with cleanup during Fedora 23 End Of Life. Thank you.)
