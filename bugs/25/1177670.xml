    <thetext>When I connect through my cell phone, either WiFi hotspot or USB connection, NM does not have a clue that the other side is a cell phone. But if we could have a switch that toggles this &quot;mobile mode&quot; (or something like that), it would be great. Then yum, dnf and others could respect that to not do package updates and alikes while on a mobile connection.</thetext>

    <thetext>This message is a reminder that Fedora 21 is nearing its end of life.
Approximately 4 (four) weeks from now Fedora will stop maintaining
and issuing updates for Fedora 21. It is Fedora&apos;s policy to close all
bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time
this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora  &apos;version&apos;
of &apos;21&apos;.

Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you
plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the &apos;version&apos; 
to a later Fedora version.

Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not 
able to fix it before Fedora 21 is end of life. If you would still like 
to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version 
of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the &apos;version&apos; to a later Fedora 
version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.

Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release&apos;s 
lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a 
more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes 
bugs or makes them obsolete.</thetext>

    <thetext>Since version 1.2 each device has a &apos;metered&apos; property which is
inherited from the connection active on the device. The default value
for connection.metered is &apos;guess&apos; which means that we use some
heuristics to determine the actual value.  First, any GSM/CDMA
connection will be automatically considered metered; then we use the
DHCP options announced by Android phones to determine if the
connection is a Ethernet-USB or WiFi tethered one. It is also possible
for users to manually set the metered status of a given connection.

In addition to the per-device metered setting (available in the

 nmcli -f general.device,general.metered device show

output) there also a global property, only exported through D-Bus
(org.fd.NM.Metered) representing the metered status of the device with
the default route. Applications can query this attribute to know
whether they should limit data usage.

    <thetext>This is awesome! Thanks
Should we open a new bug so that at least PackageKit supports reading this property?</thetext>

    <thetext>(In reply to Marcelo Ricardo Leitner from comment #6)
&gt; This is awesome! Thanks
&gt; Should we open a new bug so that at least PackageKit supports reading this
&gt; property?

I see that PackageKit reads the property but I don&apos;t see it used anywhere.

I don&apos;t think that PackageKit has the logic to automatically start an update of the metadata or of the packages, but it only provides a way for external applications to do it. So probably the check should be implemented in those applications. I&apos;m not sure of this, though.</thetext>
