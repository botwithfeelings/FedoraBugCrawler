Example script at /etc/profile.d/composer.sh to make global Composer binaries available

Description of problem:

After installing the composer Fedora package, binaries of globally installed Composer packages are not available in the command line.

I think it would be nice to somehow add the $HOME/.config/composer/vendor/bin directory to the $PATH or, alternatively, but Composer&apos;s bin-dir somewhere in $PATH.

This is my first bug report, so sorry if this is not appropriate.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):

Version: 1.2.2
Release:
1.fc25

How reproducible:


Steps to Reproduce:
1. dnf install composer
2. composer global require drush/drush
3. which drush

Actual results:
no drush in (...)

Expected results:
$HOME/.config/composer/vendor/bin/drush

    <thetext>I rather think this is something which have to be done by the user.

And instead of &quot;global install&quot; people should use packaged applications.

Most of them (drush, phpunit, composer, phpcs, phpcompatinfo... ) being available in the repository, so these should be preferred, and composer installed binaries should not interfere.</thetext>

&gt; I rather think this is something which have to be done by the user.
&gt; 

So why I opened this in the first place and why I slightly disagree is because the Composer package overrides the default behavior of storing stuff in ~/.composer and puts it into ~/.config/composer. When I saw that I thought &quot;Ahh nice, so I bet they also registered ~/.config/composer/vendor/bin in $PATH&quot;. It (at least for me) suggests a level of (OS-)integration that then turns out to not be there.

&gt; And instead of &quot;global install&quot; people should use packaged applications.
&gt; 
&gt; Most of them (drush, phpunit, composer, phpcs, phpcompatinfo... ) being
&gt; available in the repository, so these should be preferred, and composer
&gt; installed binaries should not interfere.

I guess it&apos;s just a personal preference of me to do this with Composer itself. I think its awesome to have the (subsidiary) package managers (Composer, npm, ...) packaged for the OS, but I then like to use those to manage the &quot;actual&quot; packages.

It leads to less problems in case end up wanting to install something (globally) that isn&apos;t packaged for Fedora. You could argue that I should go ahead and package it in that case, so I guess this is not really a technical argument but rather one of personal preference / convenience.

In any case, feel free to close this, I don&apos;t feel very strongly about this, I just thought it would be a nice convenience / enhancement. (It certainly would be for me ;-).)</thetext>

    <thetext>Maybe as a compromise we could provide this but comment it out by default, so that there&apos;s no change to the default behavior but it&apos;s both easier for people to enable and there is a documented best practice way of doing so?</thetext>

What ?

Absolutely no change from upstream

$ composer global require  phpunit/phpunit
Changed current directory to /home/remi/.composer
Using version ^5.6 for phpunit/phpunit
./composer.json has been updated
...

$ ls ~/.composer/vendor/bin/
phpunit</thetext>

    <thetext>Thanks for the update!

Unfortunately it does not work for me, because on my system Composer is in fact located at ~/.config/composer, so adding ~/.composer/vendor/bin to $PATH does not help.

I tracked this down to Composer itself, see the following in \Composer\Factory::getHomeDir():

        $userDir = self::getUserDir();
        if (is_dir($userDir . &apos;/.composer&apos;)) {
            return $userDir . &apos;/.composer&apos;;
        }

        if (self::useXdg()) {
            // XDG Base Directory Specifications
            $xdgConfig = getenv(&apos;XDG_CONFIG_HOME&apos;) ?: $userDir . &apos;/.config&apos;;

            return $xdgConfig . &apos;/composer&apos;;
        }

\Composer\Factory::useXdg() in turn returns TRUE if there is any key starting with &quot;XDG_&quot; in $_SERVER, of which there are many on my system. So it seems the deciding factor is a pre-existing ~/.composer directory. On a fresh installation this does not exist, so Composer ends up in ~/.config/composer.

I thought whether we could solve this problem by specifying a custom bin-dir to a user-specific location of binaries which are already in $PATH. Unfortunately I didn&apos;t see any such directory. I saw ~/bin and ~/.local/bin in .bash_profile but that is apparently not sourced normally.

When I ran

$ composer config --global bin-dir ~/.local/bin

and then sourced .bash_profile manually everything worked as expected after I installed a Composer package globally.

On the other hand, even if we do do that and somehow get ~/.local/bin into $PATH, I suppose it would only be correct to also set the vendor-dir to ~/.local/share which I&apos;m not sure is a good idea...</thetext>

    <thetext>Another workaround is: mkdir ~/.composer ;)


IMHO, XDG support in composer is (for now) at least partial, at most broken.

The current fix in the RPM is mostly for server (no XDG)

For workstation (XDG), I think this should be fixed in composer.

A bug already exists about the XDG installation layout:
https://github.com/composer/composer/issues/5041

I don&apos;t plan to add more change in the package.</thetext>
