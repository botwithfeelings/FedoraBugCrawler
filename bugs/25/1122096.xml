    <thetext>Description of problem:
The writer explorer (F5) is a great feature of libre office but when one want to promote or demote a level of several chapters at once, there is a lot of clicking required. It would be really nice if it was possible to shift-click all the chapters I wanted to demote and then just clicking &quot;demote level&quot; once.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
libreoffice-4.2.5.2-6.fc20.x86_64</thetext>

    <thetext>This message is a reminder that Fedora 20 is nearing its end of life.
Approximately 4 (four) weeks from now Fedora will stop maintaining
and issuing updates for Fedora 20. It is Fedora&apos;s policy to close all
bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time
this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora  &apos;version&apos;
of &apos;20&apos;.

Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you
plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the &apos;version&apos; 
to a later Fedora version.

Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not 
able to fix it before Fedora 20 is end of life. If you would still like 
to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version 
of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the &apos;version&apos; to a later Fedora 
version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.

Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release&apos;s 
lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a 
more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes 
bugs or makes them obsolete.</thetext>

    <thetext>Fedora 20 changed to end-of-life (EOL) status on 2015-06-23. Fedora 20 is
no longer maintained, which means that it will not receive any further
security or bug fix updates. As a result we are closing this bug.

If you can reproduce this bug against a currently maintained version of
Fedora please feel free to reopen this bug against that version. If you
are unable to reopen this bug, please file a new report against the
current release. If you experience problems, please add a comment to this
bug.

Thank you for reporting this bug and we are sorry it could not be fixed.</thetext>

    <thetext>there was an upstream bug too, 54834 

finally i&apos;ve had some time to implement this feature:
master commit bf7b5ee0c8a552625b80a7a57c32fe05ee756f7a
libreoffice-5-3 commit 946684ab33e51140f257cf497ad8c26ff4156669

however it looks like the dialog has had some rather large non-functional code  changes since 5.2 that also have introduced at least one regression so i&apos;m rather dis-inclined to backport the new feature to 5.2 / Fedora 25 but Fedora 26 should get it in time so CLOSED NEXTRELEASE.</thetext>
