    <thetext>Good:

! rpmlint checks return:


m2crypto.x86_64: W: wrong-file-end-of-line-encoding /usr/share/doc/m2crypto-0.21.1/tests/thawte.pem
This file has wrong end-of-line encoding, usually caused by creation or
modification on a non-Unix system. It could prevent it from being displayed
correctly in some circumstances.

Fix until that would break the tests.

m2crypto.x86_64: E: zero-length /usr/share/doc/m2crypto-0.21.1/demo/Zope/lib/python/Products/GuardedFile/refresh.txt

Ignore or remove.

! package meets naming guidelines   Should really be python-m2crypto.  If you submit a rename review I&apos;ll do it.  Or this could be it, really.
- package meets packaging guidelines


! license ( MIT ) I see BSD-style, Apache 2.0, MIT, Zope Public License, should this not reflect all of those?

- spec file legible, in am. english
- source matches upstream
- package compiles on devel (x86_64)
- no missing BR
- no unnecessary BR
- no locales
- not relocatable
- owns all directories that it creates
- no duplicate files
- permissions ok
- %clean ok
- macro use consistent
- code, not content
- no need for -docs
- nothing in %doc affects runtime
- no need for .desktop file 

So just rpmlint, name and license, otherwise OK.</thetext>

&gt; Ping?

I do appreciate the review, and I plan to act on it... however fixing other broken stuff is more important at the moment, I&apos;m afraid.</thetext>

    <thetext>This bug appears to have been reported against &apos;rawhide&apos; during the Fedora 23 development cycle.
Changing version to &apos;23&apos;.

(As we did not run this process for some time, it could affect also pre-Fedora 23 development
cycle bugs. We are very sorry. It will help us with cleanup during Fedora 23 End Of Life. Thank you.)

    <thetext>This message is a reminder that Fedora 23 is nearing its end of life.
Approximately 4 (four) weeks from now Fedora will stop maintaining
and issuing updates for Fedora 23. It is Fedora&apos;s policy to close all
bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time
this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora  &apos;version&apos;
of &apos;23&apos;.

Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you
plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the &apos;version&apos; 
to a later Fedora version.

Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not 
able to fix it before Fedora 23 is end of life. If you would still like 
to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version 
of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the &apos;version&apos; to a later Fedora 
version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.

Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release&apos;s 
lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a 
more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes 
bugs or makes them obsolete.</thetext>

    <thetext>License is good now, all that remains is:

2crypto.x86_64: W: invalid-url URL: https://gitlab.com/m2crypto/m2crypto/ The read operation timed out
The value should be a valid, public HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP URL.

m2crypto.x86_64: W: crypto-policy-non-compliance-openssl /usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/M2Crypto/__m2crypto.so SSL_CTX_set_cipher_list
This application package calls a function to explicitly set crypto ciphers for
SSL/TLS. That may cause the application not to use the system-wide set
cryptographic policy and should be modified in accordance to:
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:CryptoPolicies

    <thetext>(In reply to Jon Ciesla from comment #8)
&gt; License is good now, all that remains is:
&gt; 
&gt; 2crypto.x86_64: W: invalid-url URL: https://gitlab.com/m2crypto/m2crypto/
&gt; The read operation timed out
&gt; The value should be a valid, public HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP URL.

No idea, this is proper URL of the project repo.

&gt; m2crypto.x86_64: W: crypto-policy-non-compliance-openssl
&gt; /usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/M2Crypto/__m2crypto.so
&gt; SSL_CTX_set_cipher_list

&gt; SSL/TLS. That may cause the application not to use the system-wide set
&gt; cryptographic policy and should be modified in accordance to:
&gt; https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:CryptoPolicies

Of course it does contain support for SSL_CTX_set_cipher_list … AND EVERY OTHER FUNCTION PROVIDED by OpenSSL. That&apos;s the whole point of the package!</thetext>
