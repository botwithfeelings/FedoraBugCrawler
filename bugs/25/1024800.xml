    <thetext>Hi, we would like to use Python 3 on the default installation instead of Python 2 on Fedora 22.

https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Python_3_as_Default

While this package is not in minimal buildroot, it belongs to fedora-packager stack. We would like to switch to Python 3 there as well.

The goal here is, that at least for F22 you should provide python3- prefixed subpackage.

Please, help us update to Python 3 flawlessly.

Check if upstream already support Python 3, if yes, use it and add the support to the package.

If upstream doesn&apos;t support Python 3 yet, encourage it to do so by sending patches and offering your help.

When upstream is dead or unwilling to support Python 3, say so and we can solve the problem together.

Chances are, that you ARE the upstream. In that case, everything is easier, just do it yourself.

There is a table on wiki, that should list your package. Chances are, that you can see an upstream link that covers the problem. Anyway, please update the table with information you know.

https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Churchyard/python3#fedora-packager

I offer my help with this task, so if you have no idea, how to work on this, or it is just not your priority, don&apos;t hesitate to ask for help.

(As you&apos;ve already realized, this is a bulk text, so if something is not quite exact about your package, sorry for that, just ask)</thetext>

    <thetext>Ah, after looking around upstream I remember this.  Upstream committed a pull request that was supposed to add python3 support but it didn&apos;t work correctly.  I then submitted a couple pull requests to fix some things:

* https://github.com/dsc/bunch/pull/7
* https://github.com/dsc/bunch/pull/8

a year later and it seems that upstream has stopped caring about bunch.  There&apos;s some other low hanging pull requests in the bunch issue tracker.

Email sent to upstream maintainer of bunch to see if he&apos;s still alive.  If I don&apos;t reply here it probably means he hasn&apos;t replied to me.  Feel free to ping this bug and we can figure out other options if that&apos;s the case (Perhaps fork?)</thetext>

    <thetext>Just took a look at bunch on python3 and found that it is still unresponsive upstream.  Here&apos;s one fork that was active recently:

https://github.com/Infinidat/munch

Several simple pull requests were opened against it 19 days ago.  It will be interesting to see if those are merged in a timely manner.

The code as is says that it supports python-3.4 but I have not yet tested it.</thetext>

    <thetext>Just for the record, I&apos;ve tried to contact the upstream maintainer of bunch via email (I found two different mails, actually) and he&apos;s just not responding, so switching to munch seems to be the best way to go.</thetext>

    <thetext>Fedora 22 changed to end-of-life (EOL) status on 2016-07-19. Fedora 22 is
no longer maintained, which means that it will not receive any further
security or bug fix updates. As a result we are closing this bug.

If you can reproduce this bug against a currently maintained version of
Fedora please feel free to reopen this bug against that version. If you
are unable to reopen this bug, please file a new report against the
current release. If you experience problems, please add a comment to this
bug.

Thank you for reporting this bug and we are sorry it could not be fixed.</thetext>

    <thetext>Miro, why was this re-opened?

I thought the consensus was to port applications to python3-munch (which behaves just like &apos;bunch&apos;, but is python3 ready).  Is there a reason to go back and port python-bunch?</thetext>
