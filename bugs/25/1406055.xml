    <thetext>Description of problem:
Undocking problem with Lenovo T460p in Fedora 25, after undocking, primary external monitor (dvi) stays still primary, secondary laptop, and can&apos;t use mouse neither keyboard, all I can do is power off button (in Gnome over Xorg, but same happened in regular Gnome)

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
kernel-core-4.8.14-300.fc25.x86_64 (very similar problem was in kernel from fedora24 : kernel-core-4.8.6-201.fc24.x86_64 (but there was sometimes chance that it wouldn&apos;t freeze)

How reproducible:
happened to me all the time I&apos;ve tried that kernel

Steps to Reproduce:
1. connect external monitor over DVI, and set it as primary
2. set up laptop display as secondary display
3. undock from docking station

Actual results:
freezes/unresponsive, laptop monitor stays secondary, while external monitor stays primary even when is turned off


Expected results:
laptop would be primary and system wouldn&apos;t freeze

    <thetext>The bug is still there in Fedora 25 with kernel version 4.9.14-200. It freezes every single time a laptop is removed from the docking station and it needs to be restarted then. This is really annoying when you want to use your laptop at a meeting every day and need to wait several minutes to restart it and run all the applications again.</thetext>
