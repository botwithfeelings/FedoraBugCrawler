    <thetext>Description of problem:

After the update to Mesa 13, some Steam games like CS:GO and Dota 2 started crashing on startup.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):

13.0.2-1.fc25

Additional info:

I have opened a bug report against CS:GO on Valve&apos;s GitHub issue tracker. I don&apos;t know which side should fix this as it seems to be a version incompatibility but the linked issues and recent comments indicate that other distributions have worked around this issue by linking mesa against nettle instead of openssl.

    <thetext>they say, it´s a Fedora issue and not a Steam or CS:GO issue:
https://github.com/ValveSoftware/csgo-osx-linux/issues/1249#issuecomment-266442969

I say it´s an urgent bug that needs to be fixed fast.</thetext>

    <thetext>it IS steam issue because they bundle OpenSSL which causes collisions.</thetext>

afox, for now u could downgrade ur mesa-dri-drivers:

dnf downgrade --allowerasing mesa-dri-drivers

Version 12.0.3 is ok.

&gt; it IS steam issue because they bundle OpenSSL which causes collisions.

Actually we should think about the goal here, steam is really important software, so even if its Valve`s issue, fedora maintainers could build mesa to avoid this problem. Because whats the point to have linux distribution which cant run needed soft?

Also the solution already mentioned on valve`s bugzilla, ty</thetext>

Well, it isn&apos;t that black and white. Steam might not be the only thing on Linux that doesn&apos;t use the system OpenSSL and the way symbols are resolved with ELF images doesn&apos;t really help at all.

It isn&apos;t uncommon for programs to link against libGL and OpenSSL. Would you really expect the GL library to pull in OpenSSL which could cause interesting symbol conflicts with ELF and in this case even a version conflict?

This is probably something that needs to be resolved between the Mesa developers and binary distributors like Valve but nevertheless it&apos;s a serious issue for your *users* even if you didn&apos;t directly cause it so don&apos;t take it too lightly.</thetext>

I didn&apos;t say that I am not going to workaround this, I care about users very much.</thetext>
