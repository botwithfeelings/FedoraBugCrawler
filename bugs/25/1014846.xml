[far too many errors to transcribe here]
Some of them may be false positives due to use of the libestools.so
garbage collector (if I interpret valgrind backtraces properly).  There
appear many definite errors too.</thetext>

    <thetext>This message is a notice that Fedora 19 is now at end of life. Fedora 
has stopped maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 19. It is 
Fedora&apos;s policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no 
longer maintained. Approximately 4 (four) weeks from now this bug will
be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora &apos;version&apos; of &apos;19&apos;.

Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you
plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the &apos;version&apos; 
to a later Fedora version.

Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not 
able to fix it before Fedora 19 is end of life. If you would still like 
to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version 
of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the &apos;version&apos; to a later Fedora 
version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.

Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release&apos;s 
lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a 
more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes 
bugs or makes them obsolete.</thetext>

    <thetext>Fedora 22 changed to end-of-life (EOL) status on 2016-07-19. Fedora 22 is
no longer maintained, which means that it will not receive any further
security or bug fix updates. As a result we are closing this bug.

If you can reproduce this bug against a currently maintained version of
Fedora please feel free to reopen this bug against that version. If you
are unable to reopen this bug, please file a new report against the
current release. If you experience problems, please add a comment to this
bug.

Thank you for reporting this bug and we are sorry it could not be fixed.</thetext>

    <thetext>The Festival package in Fedora needs a lot of work to update to a newer release, fix a lot of bugs, and generally clean up the packaging. And, despite best intentions, we just haven&apos;t had the developer interest in doing so. 

The current plan is to retire Festival from Fedora. See thread at https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UOL4ETKKOFGTFZZ36V726OF7UTHYMEYP/ for discussion.

Despite being large, slow, and fragile, Festival is interesting software and as far as I know can produce the best quality results of any open-source TTS system. It would be nice if there is interest in continuing it, but that should probably be done from a clean slate in any case.

In the meantime, I think it&apos;s most honest to close the currently-open bugs as &quot;WONTFIX&quot;. Thanks everyone for your reports and effort in making Fedora better.</thetext>
