    <thetext>Bug is still present on Fedora 24. Since nobody cares to reopen the original bug report I&apos;m cloning this bug.

+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #1237277 +++

Description of problem:
Apparently whenever I end the GNOME session by either logging out out of the session, rebooting or powering off my laptop (all using the top right corner GNOME Shell applet), the session ends before any apps have a chance to exit cleanly.
This is apparent the next time I start Firefox - it asks me to restore a crashed session instead of starting normally.
Another example is LibreOffice Writer which does not get a chance to ask me whether I want to save the document on which I&apos;m working. What&apos;s worse, it&apos;s not possible to recover the document because the temporary working copy LO makes got deleted (just by logging off and on again).

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
dnf list installed
http://ur1.ca/myu9v

fpaste --sysinfo
http://ur1.ca/myuaj

How reproducible:
Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start default GNOME session.
2. Start Firefox, open a few web pages.
3. Start LibreOffice Writer, make some changes to the default empty document.
4. End the GNOME session by either logging out the current user or by restarting / powering off the computer.

Actual results:
All open applications are closed/killed immediately.

Expected results:
Firefox would exit cleanly. LibreOffice Writer would ask if I want to save the changes I made to my document.

Additional info:
Using up-to-date Fedora 22 Workstation x86_64 on Lenovo T420

--- Additional comment from Fedora End Of Life on 2016-07-19 11:08:14 EDT ---

Fedora 22 changed to end-of-life (EOL) status on 2016-07-19. Fedora 22 is
no longer maintained, which means that it will not receive any further
security or bug fix updates. As a result we are closing this bug.

If you can reproduce this bug against a currently maintained version of
Fedora please feel free to reopen this bug against that version. If you
are unable to reopen this bug, please file a new report against the
current release. If you experience problems, please add a comment to this
bug.

Thank you for reporting this bug and we are sorry it could not be fixed.

--- Additional comment from Christian Stadelmann on 2016-07-24 14:26:54 EDT ---

This issue is still present. Can you please reopen this bug and change version to 24?</thetext>

I think this issue is different now. See below.


This issue is still present in Wayland F25. Now on every logout I get 1…5 applications crashing and showing up in abrt later on.

I guess this crasher is caused by gnome-shell stopping as a wayland compositor before all wayland clients have exited, resulting in the clients crashing due to protocol errors.

Some example bugs:
#1373517
#1378569
#1378570
#1378566

Note that this might be an issue in gnome-shell, not gnome-session. Feel free to change the &quot;component&quot; field since you probably know better than I do.

Affected software:
looks like all applications (or at least all applications running on wayland backend) could be affected. Not limited to Gtk+ 3.x applications but also affecting Qt5 applications.

How reproducible:
on almost every logout.

Steps to reproduce:
1. log in into a gnome@wayland session
2. start some applications or search in gnome-shell triggering start of search providers
3. log out
4. log in again, have a look at gnome-abrt and its crashes listed

Software versions:
gnome-shell-3.21.92-1.fc25
gnome-session-3.21.90-1.fc25
libwayland-client-1.12.0-1.fc25
systemd-231-4.fc25

Additional info:
I can&apos;t test right now whether this bug is specific to wayland sessions since I can&apos;t log in into gnome@X11 due to another bug.</thetext>

    <thetext>In case wayland will be default in F25, this bug will cause crash notifications on every login but the first one. This is no exact violation of the final release criteria:
&quot;There must be no SELinux denial notifications or crash notifications on boot of or during installation from a release-blocking live image, or at first login after a default install of a release-blocking desktop. &quot;

Due to the high impact of happening on _every_ successive login I think it should be a blocker anyway.</thetext>

    <thetext>The criterion we considered for the older bug was the &apos;data loss&apos; criterion - basically, if apps don&apos;t get the opportunity to shut down cleanly, you could lose unsaved data in them unexpectedly...we could consider the same one here. I&apos;ll try and find a bit of time to look into this; CCing kparal, who may also be interested.</thetext>

&gt; (But it has been for a while; I wouldn&apos;t recommend this as a blocker.)

I think always crashing applications on every logout is a major bug and should be fixed. At least for sending a SIGTERM to applications on the same user session and waiting for 1…5 seconds to exit.

&gt; I was discussing this with halfline last week. gnome-session&apos;s XSMP support is pretty broken!

I think this bug is about wayland, not X. Does gnome@wayland use XSMP for wayland applications?</thetext>

    <thetext>Discussed during the 2016-09-26 blocker review meeting: [1]

The decision to classify this bug as a RejectedBlocker was made due to the fact that the resolution of the blocker would be to classify it as &quot;CommonBugs&quot; which we will do regardless of whether or not the bug is marked as a blocker.

    <thetext>I think all of these bugs: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/buglist.cgi?classification=Fedora&amp;list_id=5956197&amp;longdesc=gdk_event_source_check&amp;longdesc_type=allwordssubstr&amp;product=Fedora&amp;query_format=advanced&amp;short_desc=SIGTRAP&amp;short_desc_type=allwordssubstr

are duplicates of this one. At least all of them with &quot;gdk_event_source_check()&quot; in their title.

I think that if this is not fixed before F25 is released (with wayland by default), Fedora&apos;s infrastructure (most notably retrace server) will have to handle hundreds or thousands of these crashes per day.</thetext>

Not sure this is related to our discussion, actually.

Maybe a regression from this commit?

&gt; This also prevents Emacs for saving modified files for later recovery, which
&gt; it would do on SIGTERM.

I highly doubt that Emacs is affected by this. This is a crash in GTK+. You&apos;ll want to open another bug for the Emacs issue.</thetext>

&gt; from this one in 1394937. It&apos;s a very fuzzy report.

It&apos;s completely different, that bug is about processes getting SIGKILL from systemd, this bug is about a crash in GTK+. Actually I see there&apos;s no backtrace in this &quot;original&quot; bug, but we&apos;ve duped 20 different GTK+ crash reports against this bug that are all the same crash in gdk_event_source_check. So this bug covers one specific crash, and if you&apos;re hitting some other issue not this crash, you need a different bug. Let me rename the title for clarity.

&gt; What happens if you have emacs running inside a gnome-terminal?

I don&apos;t known, but I guess emacs will probably receive SIGHUP as a side effect of gnome-terminal dying. So that would be a third way for a process to die at logout. :) Anyway, I doubt that&apos;s the scenario of the complaint in comment #23.</thetext>

    <thetext>Anyway SIGKILL is a much less serious issue as it doesn&apos;t trigger the cascade of ABRT reports like crashing does. Even just powering off or rebooting your computer without closing all your apps manually can trigger this from many apps; it&apos;s really embarrassing for us and we&apos;ll be lucky if reviewers don&apos;t complain about the flood of crash notices when they log in. It should have been a blocker under the no ABRT notifications criterion, but it&apos;s true that it&apos;s a bit iffy as it is possible to avoid the crashes by closing everything manually, and also we probably didn&apos;t recognize the scope of the problem at the blocker meeting.</thetext>

    <thetext>Um. What happens is, when you log out of GNOME-on-Wayland, a lot of running apps &apos;crash&apos; because they just get SIGKILLed (I think). This shows up as a crash in abrt - typically this backtrace running through gdk_event_source_check - but it&apos;s not really some kind of actual crasher bug in GTK+. It&apos;s just the apps being killed on logout.

Just try it - have some apps running, log out, log back in, and see if you get an abrt notification for a bunch of &apos;crashed&apos; apps.</thetext>

No, if you check the backtraces it really is just a crash that has nothing to do with SIGKILL; SIGKILL would not cause crash warnings from ABRT anyway. It is caused by the Wayland compositor going away. All GTK+ clients crash when that happens, it hits a g_error (SIGTRAP crash) &quot;Error reading events from display: Broken pipe&quot;. Actually it&apos;s arguably the opposite problem; if applications received SIGKILL they wouldn&apos;t then have any opportunity to go on and crash. :)</thetext>

    <thetext>I&apos;m still thinking this is a bug in gnome-shell, not in Gtk+, because applications will also crash when the X server dies. So I think the issue has to be fixed in gnome-shell, not in Gtk+.

So how about solving the issue this way in gnome-shell:
1. After a user chooses logout or shutdown, send a SIGTERM to all GUI applications (i.e. all wayland and X11 clients). Gnome-shell has this list already in its &quot;looking glass&quot; window list you can get by pressing [Alt]+[F2], &quot;lg&quot;, [Enter]. In fact there is a bit more to that, e.g. applications which only have a tray icon.
2. wait for the children to die with a timeout (e.g. 30 seconds).
3. after one second, show a dialog with all remaining applications and provide a way to force-kill the apps
4. after time runs out or user chose to force-kill, send SIGKILL to processes.</thetext>

    <thetext>So gdk/wayland/gdkeventsource.c:gdk_event_source_check has this in it:

      if (source-&gt;pfd.revents &amp; G_IO_IN)•
        {•
          if (wl_display_read_events (display_wayland-&gt;wl_display) &lt; 0)•
            g_error (&quot;Error reading events from display: %s&quot;, g_strerror (errno));•
        }•

The equivalent situation with the X backend is gdk/x11/gdkmain-11.c:gdk_x_io_error which has:

  if (errno == EPIPE)•
    {•
      g_warning (&quot;The application &apos;%s&apos; lost its connection to the display %s;\n&quot;•
                 &quot;most likely the X server was shut down or you killed/destroyed\n&quot;•
                 &quot;the application.\n&quot;,•
                 g_get_prgname (),•
                 display ? DisplayString (display) : gdk_get_display_arg_name ());•
    }•
  else•  
    {•
      g_warning (&quot;%s: Fatal IO error %d (%s) on X server %s.\n&quot;,•
                 g_get_prgname (),•
                 errno, g_strerror (errno),•
                 display ? DisplayString (display) : gdk_get_display_arg_name ());•
    }•
•
  _exit (1);•

I honestly don&apos;t think either behavior is right, if the display connection goes away, we don&apos;t need a stampede of applications announcing that fact (g_message sure, whatever, but not g_error or g_warning).  But at a minimum, gtk on wayland should exit and not g_error to reach parity with X11 but I think we should cut out the nastygrams from both sides really.  

Still, I guess the problem leading to the messages is gnome-shell is exiting before other clients, and we should fix that too (which i guess would be a gnome-session fix)</thetext>

My thoughts exactly. Ideally, applications would save state (if they have any)
when that happens, and exit cleanly.

&gt; Still, I guess the problem leading to the messages is gnome-shell is exiting
&gt; before other clients, and we should fix that too (which i guess would be a
&gt; gnome-session fix)

Yep, that should be pursued in parallel, but is probably much more complex than 1.</thetext>

I think it warrants g_warning because _exit doesn&apos;t allow the application to shutdown cleanly; it&apos;s not hard to imagine data loss caused by quitting without running exit handlers or SIGTERM handlers.</thetext>

I had opened the following GIF with Epiphany on webapp mode: https://twitter.com/madtrick/status/831440822730162177

Sometimes it just crashes (which lead to this report), but it often freezes my desktop and I have no other choice but restart the computer.

&gt; Sometimes it just crashes (which lead to this report), but it often freezes
&gt; my desktop and I have no other choice but restart the computer.

This is a different bug. You should report the crash in gnome-shell or XWayland in this case. The crash in Gtk+ is just a result of that. By the way, It looks like you are still on Fedora 24. In Fedora 24, Wayland was not the default choice for GNOME desktop, so please use X11 or update to Fedora 25.

&gt; I had opened the following GIF with Epiphany on webapp mode: https://twitter.com/madtrick/status/831440822730162177

I cannot reproduce that. Can you retry with Fedora 25?

Looks like a different bug to me too. This bug report (1366897) is only for the crashes resulting in logout, not for any other application crashes.</thetext>

&gt; So gdk/wayland/gdkeventsource.c:gdk_event_source_check has this in it:
&gt;
&gt; [...]
&gt;
&gt; The equivalent situation with the X backend is
&gt; gdk/x11/gdkmain-11.c:gdk_x_io_error which has:
&gt; 
&gt; [...]
&gt; 
&gt; I honestly don&apos;t think either behavior is right, if the display connection
&gt; goes away, we don&apos;t need a stampede of applications announcing that fact
&gt; (g_message sure, whatever, but not g_error or g_warning).  But at a minimum,
&gt; gtk on wayland should exit and not g_error to reach parity with X11 but I
&gt; think we should cut out the nastygrams from both sides really.  

For what it is worth, the X11 backends logging was demoted in:
