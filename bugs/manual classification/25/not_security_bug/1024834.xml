<thetext>Hi, we would like to use Python 3 on the default installation instead of Python 2 on Fedora 22. https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Python_3_as_Default While this package is not in minimal buildroot, it belongs to fedora-packager stack.
We would like to switch to Python 3 there as well. The goal here is, that at least for F22 you should provide python3- prefixed subpackage. Please, help us update to Python 3 flawlessly. Check if upstream already support Python 3, if yes, use it and
add the support to the package. If upstream doesn&apos;t support Python 3 yet, encourage it to do so by sending patches and offering your help. When upstream is dead or unwilling to support Python 3, say so and we can solve the problem together.
Chances are, that you ARE the upstream. In that case, everything is easier, just do it yourself. There is a table on wiki, that should list your package. Chances are, that you can see an upstream link that covers the problem. Anyway, please update
the table with information you know. https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Churchyard/python3#fedora-packager I offer my help with this task, so if you have no idea, how to work on this, or it is just not your priority, don&apos;t hesitate to ask for
help. (As you&apos;ve already realized, this is a bulk text, so if something is not quite exact about your package, sorry for that, just ask)</thetext>

<thetext>Fedora 22 changed to end-of-life (EOL) status on 2016-07-19. Fedora 22 is no longer maintained, which means that it will not receive any further security or bug fix updates. As a result we are closing this bug. If you can reproduce this bug
against a currently maintained version of Fedora please feel free to reopen this bug against that version. If you are unable to reopen this bug, please file a new report against the current release. If you experience problems, please add a comment to
this bug. Thank you for reporting this bug and we are sorry it could not be fixed.</thetext>

<thetext>python-krbV is unlikely to ever support python 3. The recommendation is to convert to python-gssapi, which is actively maintained and should support everything python-krbV is capable of (though with a different API).</thetext>
