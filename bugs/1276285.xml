<thetext>Libreswan upstream has added support for activation via management socket recently and we&apos;d like to use it for Fedora 24 IPSec VPN support. It will activate the libreswan IPSec/IKE managment daemon as soon as the user activates an IPSec
VPN network and won&apos;t impact installations where IPSec is not used or libreswan not installed. Currently, to achieve the same effect, NetworkManager checks whether the service is started and starts a private instance if not and that&apos;s just
not nice. Please add following to preset policy file. # IPSec management enable pluto.socket</thetext>

<thetext>Is my understanding correct that with pluto.socket enabled in presets, after installation of the package, anyone connecting to the socket will activate the daemon?</thetext>

<thetext>This is an internal-only socket, correct? It&apos;s not exposing a network, port. Is this useful for all Editions of Fedora or is this more Workstation-targeted? (This is needed to explain whether it belongs in the common presets or the
Edition-specific ones).</thetext>

&gt; I wasn&apos;t sure if that was the case or if such VPNs happened at the router &gt; level. I have no problem putting it in the global presets. I just wanted to &gt; be able to point to a reason why. It depends on the use case. In a lot of
banking and sites like PCI-DSS (Payment card industry - data security standards) require host to host encryption. IPSEC can use opportunistic encryption [1] which is supported by at least some (maybe all) of the *SWAN implementations. [1]

needed to explain whether it belongs in the &gt; common presets or the Edition-specific ones). I guess for server installations the sysadmin would like to enable the service also for non-user initiated connections. Therefore they&apos;re expected to
&quot;systemctl enable ipsec&quot; anyway. Since we don&apos;t do server connections with the NetworkManager plugin (yet), I&apos;m fine with having this enabled just for the Workstation edition.</thetext>

too).</thetext>
