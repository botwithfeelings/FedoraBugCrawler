    <thetext>Description of problem: was testing the new pmchart feature to pop up an instance/value list via left-mouse selection - love it! But this now seems to have overridden the ability to select the current chart (for editing, e.g. with Edit/Chart). In addition, there is no longer any visual indication of the current chart. (You can actually select the current chart, but only by invoking the dialog).

One other nasty effect is that a chart with no plots (e.g. due to a broken view being loaded), can&apos;t be selected and hence can&apos;t be deleted or edited.

I guess maybe we need to use the middle or right mouse button to select the current chart? Or perhaps change to using middle mouse to pop up the instance/values dialog?

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): pcp-3.11.6-1</thetext>

    <thetext>Interesting. My intent was to add the pop up window *in addition* to what was already being done when left clicking on a chart. I&apos;m wondering if popping up the window as the last action taken has somehow undone the selection of the chart.

The original RFE for the pop up did request use of the right mouse button, but I was unable to find support for that in the ChartPicker class.</thetext>

    <thetext>IIRC its a more generic event, Dave, supported by all widgets - (looking in ChartPicker &amp; QwtPicker might not find it as a result)

    http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/qmouseevent.html

The double-click event might be another option (QEvent::MouseButtonDblClick) - some platforms have single-button mice (Mac) - perhaps both double click and right click could be intercepted for this popup.</thetext>

    <thetext>&gt;
&gt; double click and right click could be intercepted for this popup.

that would work. The other thing is the highlighting of the current chart seems to have been lost.

My use-case the other day was a series of charts plotting per-cpu/per-IRQ interrupt rates on a 20-CPU/2-node VMware guest system (with Legend off for obvious reasons!), and trying to figure out which interrupts were misbehaving on the guest after it was vMotion&apos;ed from one hypervisor to another .. and to correlate this with other system level activity on both the guest and the two hypervisors. The instance/value popup was very useful here.

Another obvious use-case is charting per-process metrics - the legend and color schemes are basically useless because there are simply too many instances.</thetext>
