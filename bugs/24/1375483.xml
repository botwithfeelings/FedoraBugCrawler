    <thetext>Hi. This bug completely disappear on kernel 4.9.14 Along all time (weeks) when I was on kernel 4.9.14 this bug never occurred.

However, it re-emerge (BUT IN NEW FASHION &amp; FORUM) when I upgrade to kernel 4.9.15
Original bug was that wifi die completely &amp; I need to either power off/on wifi hotkey or some times to restart my PC to be able to connect to Internet via wifi.

Now the case is as following: the wifi suddenly &amp; unexpectedly - especially when I stand on a page for time like 5 minutes without navigation activity, like now when I type this replay - BUT I HAVE NO NEED TO POWER OFF/ON WIFI OR RESTART MY PC. All what I have to do now is waiting browser working &amp; working &amp; working (for about 2 - 3 minutes) to be able to re-establish Internet transmission to new page.

Please your kind review for this new case. I&apos;m not sure whether it&apos;s place here or need to open new bug. This new case is annoying since just if I remain on a web page for about 5 minutes without navigation, then my wifi will hiccup ! 

Also, it seem that the problems (old &amp; recent) related to kernel modules not to the wifiroamd. Please to review this point also.

Best.</thetext>
