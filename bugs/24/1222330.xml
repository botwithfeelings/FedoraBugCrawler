    <thetext>The most recent versions of the Horde application framework use PHP/PEAR Math_BigInteger-1.0.2, which became available a while back.  Please upgrade our Fedora 21, 22, rawhide packages when you are able.  Thank you.</thetext>

    <thetext>This message is a reminder that Fedora 21 is nearing its end of life.
Approximately 4 (four) weeks from now Fedora will stop maintaining
and issuing updates for Fedora 21. It is Fedora&apos;s policy to close all
bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time
this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora  &apos;version&apos;
of &apos;21&apos;.

Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you
plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the &apos;version&apos; 
to a later Fedora version.

Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not 
able to fix it before Fedora 21 is end of life. If you would still like 
to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version 
of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the &apos;version&apos; to a later Fedora 
version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.

Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release&apos;s 
lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a 
more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes 
bugs or makes them obsolete.</thetext>

    <thetext>1.0 is unfortunately a backwards-incompatible update, and ownCloud 8.0 still needs the 0.3 branch. ownCloud uses phpseclib 2.0 since OC 8.2, but one of the major roadblocks to updating ownCloud past 8.0 is that 8.1 and 8.2 require sabredav 2.1, while Horde still needs sabredav 1.8. A nice Mexican stand-off, eh? :)</thetext>

    <thetext>Hello Anthony -- I have just been given ownership of this package.  Are you still in need of the phpseclibs PEAR-stack update since the single php-phpseclibs pkg (v2) is now available?

Adding Remi to this bug since he owns the Horde stack in Fedora/EPEL.</thetext>

Yes, certain Horde components need this.  I am trying to reduce the external deps installed via PEAR.  Since Fedora already has this package, it seemed like it should be updated in Fedora, rather than overridden by a local PEAR install.</thetext>

    <thetext>In fact Horde requires pear/math_biginteger. This fork was used instead as available in Fedora.

phpseclib pear stack (v1) is still maintained.
pear/math_biginteger is also maintained (only by QA guy), version 1.0.3 is PHP 7 compatible.


One issue with the big phpseclib stack, is that we have 15 packages, but
- upstream doesn&apos;t manage per component version (all components released on each updates)
- no test suite


Perhaps we can add php-pear-math-biginteger, and switch to it for 
- php-horde-Horde-Mapi
- php-pear-Numbers-Words


Which will allow to be closer to upstream requirement, and to retire phpseclib v1.</thetext>
