    <thetext>While testing a new build of fedora-bookmarks, I discovered that, though valid, the Fedora bookmarks don&apos;t appear in the bookmark tree in a brand new account and Firefox profile.  I&apos;m asking for some help to figure out why, and quickly, since the Final Freeze happens May 31.

I&apos;m happy to help from the fedora-bookmarks packaging side if this turns out to be a problem with the bookmark content, and not something that&apos;s changed on the Firefox side.</thetext>

    <thetext>That&apos;s because fedora-bookmarks is BuildRequires - used only when the package is composed and the bookmark file is packages inside firefox data file. I&apos;ll update spec to make it clear. We have to rebuild Firefox anyway so that should be fixed soon.</thetext>

    <thetext>Reopening -- I don&apos;t think the rebuild is the issue.  Using either the previous build, or the new 46.0.1-7 build, I did the following:

1. useradd a new account
2. login as new account
3. open Firefox and then Show All Bookmarks

The Fedora bookmarks don&apos;t appear anywhere in the listings.  I do have fedora-bookmarks-24-1.fc24 installed.  If there&apos;s something else I should be doing to reproduce proper behavior, let me know.

Is there some other change in Firefox that would result in the bookmarks not being picked up?</thetext>

    <thetext>Hi Martin, thanks for the build.  Unfortunately, the new build appears to use the content of astronomy-bookmarks instead of fedora-bookmarks.  Maybe that one is &quot;winning&quot; the Requires because it comes first alphabetically?</thetext>

    <thetext>That must be something broken in koji build setup. See the root log:

https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org//packages/firefox/46.0.1/8.fc24/data/logs/x86_64/root.log

fedora-bookmarks is not installed but astronomy-bookmarks is. Firefox has BuildRequires: system-bookmarks which can be any package what provides that and allows to build various spins with different ones.

I see that fedora-bookmarks also provides &quot;system-bookmarks&quot; so this is a problem with build config rather than Firefox itself.</thetext>

    <thetext>so this is not supposed to be a build time thing, but a runtime one. users should get the bookmarks set by what is installed, this is to allow  spins and different versions of fedora to have a different set of bookmarks.  so there is a bug in firefox if its hardcoded in at buildtime.  a ugly bandaid would be to BuildRequire: fedora-bookmarks temporarily. however firefox needs to pick up at runtime based on whatever package providing system-bookmarks is installed.</thetext>

Okay, but that&apos;s more feature request than a bug - we use the bookmarks this way since ever. We surely can work on that to pick bookmarks runtime, but it&apos;s a different issue.

Why does it troubles us right now and was working before? Does the composition process changed or so?</thetext>

It is a regression not a feature Request. when the system was setup that is how it worked. 

I am having trouble finding details but the astronomy-bookmarks review has some https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=432265

I suspect that what changed is firefox&apos;s behaviour</thetext>

    <thetext>I&apos;ve found a solution that should solve our problem and simplify Martin&apos;s work as well.  As of ~v45, there is a &quot;distribution.ini&quot; file that allows runtime additions to bookmarks, extensions/add-ons, etc.:

https://wiki.mozilla.org/Distribution_INI_File

We want to solve for four goals, as I see it:
(1) Allow spins to include their own custom bookmarks
(2) Preserve the remixability of Fedora
(3) Avoid dragging in the wrong custom bookmarks for the general Firefox build
(4) Solve similarly for related browsers (icecat, seamonkey currently)

Proposed solution:

(1) Astronomy spin updates (adding maintainer to CC)
   (a) rework astronomy-bookmarks content as a distribution.ini file
      (i) write file into %{_sharedir}/bookmarks/distribution.ini
   (b) drops the &quot;Provides: system-bookmarks&quot; in its spec file
   (c) add scriptlet 
   (d) add astronomy-bookmarks to the spin kickstart explicitly
   (Astronomy is the only spin doing this, but future spins could do likewise)

(2) Firefox package updates
   (a) package a symlink %{_libdir}/firefox/distribution/distribution.ini -&gt; %{_sharedir)/bookmarks/distribution.ini

Solved:
* In the case of a standard Fedora edition, fedora-bookmarks should be included automatically in the build of Firefox.
* In the case of a spin, their specific bookmarks will be added to the Fedora bookmarks -- no need to choose between syncing bookmarks or replacing
* It&apos;s not clear icecat or seamonkey have the distribution.ini capability, but that would be a downstream problem; if a spin decides to use it as default, should be able to handle via a new *-bookmarks and kickstart
* Remixers can still similarly use their own system-bookmarks providing package


Does this sound reasonable?</thetext>

Sure, I don&apos;t have any problem with that if it works for you. Let me know when the bookmarks are updated so we can rebuild Firefox for that.</thetext>

    <thetext>I added the owner of astronomy-bookmarks, thought that was lupinix but was wrong. Since the bookmarks are quite outdated, and are removed from the spin, we should ask Marek to at least do (1)(b) above (drop Provides:system-bookmarks, rebuild and issue update).</thetext>

    <thetext>Martin, it seems that astronomy-bookmarks should have been submitted together with firefox in a single update? See bug 1343740.

Adam, when requesting this update to be pushed stable, please be aware that there&apos;s a potential situation of breaking the deps. We should figure out whether it&apos;s safe to push just firefox stable, or both firefox and astronomy-bookmarks have to go together.</thetext>

I tried this and it seems it is safe to push just firefox stable, or firefox+astronomy-bookmarks stable. The dependency problem appears only if just astronomy-bookmarks are pushed stable and the corresponding firefox is not available.</thetext>

Yes, that&apos;s correct, because new Firefox does not contain dependency to system-bookmarks provided by fedora|astronomy-bookmarks. The *-bookmarks dependency is only a build time, not run time.</thetext>

    <thetext>Martin,
I am working on a Fedora Remix (https://github.com/RITlug/TigerOS) and I was wondering if the bookmarks are still pulled at build time and embedded in Firefox. I would like to add custom bookmarks to the remix but adding the tigeros-bookmarks package and excluding the fedora-bookmarks package does not seem to have any effect. Is it possible to change the bookmarks at runtime as Dennis mentioned above?</thetext>

    <thetext>Yes, it&apos;s still build time. I&apos;ll happily take a patch which changes that to run-time bookmark pickup but I don&apos;t have a time to work on that right now.</thetext>
