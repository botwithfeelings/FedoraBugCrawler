    <thetext>Description of problem:
Update Request.
I was just going to ask for  an upgrade since 7.6.x supports open-source OCL drivers (eg. Mesa) and current version 7.2.42 doesn&apos;t.  But, I also just found out that 7.2.x doesn&apos;t support GCC 6, so rebuilding with 7.6 is probably necessary before F24 freezes.</thetext>

    <thetext>Aside from the GCC 6 dependency, which is firm, there are two other fixes in other packages that are related to this requrest.  Please let me know if I should open separate bugs/requests for them.

1) 7.6 BOINC manager requires wxWidgets 3.0.1, so that pkg will also need an update.

2) libclc has a bug tickled by at least one BOINC project&apos;s application.  A patch exists and has been tested.  This package also needs to be updated in order to achieve proper OCL support (for OSS drivers) as I&apos;m requesting.</thetext>

    <thetext>As far I can see from BOINC website, the lastest Linux stable version is still 7.2.42, so we need to wait for 7.6 becoming stable</thetext>

    <thetext>Yes, I know what you mean.  But, I talked to the BOINC &quot;help desk&quot; people and knowledgeable testers on the forums and they said that the only reason they haven&apos;t updated the package on their download page is because wxWidgets needs a patch (not just v3.0.1 as I stated before) and not many distributions have incorporated the patch, yet.  They are suggesting that they would wait until the patch hits the distributions before making a new package...but, I&apos;m sure you don&apos;t want to wait because:

1) AFAIK, 7.6 is stable.  There isn&apos;t anything wrong with the Linux &quot;version&quot; of 7.4 or 7.6; that&apos;s not why they haven&apos;t build a new package.  They&apos;re only holding back from posting a new package because dependencies wouldn&apos;t be met in many distributions, including Fedora.

2) Moreover, 7.2.x *will not build with GCC 6.*  The BOINC guys also told me that they know F24 is going to come with GCC 6--they must be keeping an eye on Fedora or else how would they know that.

I&apos;m hoping we can get all four of these packages updated soon, but I mainly want to make sure that these updates make it in to F24, at the latest, since, as I understand it, F24 will require going to 7.6.

I&apos;m sure I can get patches for wxWidgets and libclc.  I was going to try to use SRPMS of all them, make them work, and send you some patches.  I&apos;m sure you could do it faster and better, but I&apos;m willing to help out if you want.</thetext>

    <thetext>(In reply to Paul DeStefano from comment #3)
&gt; Yes, I know what you mean.  But, I talked to the BOINC &quot;help desk&quot; people
&gt; and knowledgeable testers on the forums and they said that the only reason
&gt; they haven&apos;t updated the package on their download page is because wxWidgets
&gt; needs a patch (not just v3.0.1 as I stated before) and not many
&gt; distributions have incorporated the patch, yet.

Do you mean the package wxGTK3? Does upstream wxWidgets developers made a new release that includes the patch?</thetext>

    <thetext>Sorry, I was away last week...

I&apos;m not sure; perhaps it is the GTK3 pkg.  BOINC folks said &quot;wxWidgets&quot;, so I can&apos;t be sure.  I see your point; it&apos;s probably not a problem with wxBase.  I&apos;ll work on getting you all the details I can.  More soon.</thetext>
