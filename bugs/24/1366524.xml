    <thetext>xfig / transfig have a new upstream maintainer and 3.2.6 has been released, incorporating all patches from all distros.

I&apos;ve already updated xfig for F25+ to 3.2.6, can you please update transfig? Note the tarbal is now called fig2dev and can be found here:

    <thetext>Hi Hans, I have updated spec file and submited it into rawhide. In compared to previous version there are missing some binaries. I will be happy if someone can test if it works as expected.

I have dropped all patches. There were some patches to IMakefile which was replaced by autotools. The other patches were already applied. I wasn&apos;t able to apply patch CVE-2009-4227. The file is missing so it is not usable. I will be happy if someone else could confirm that it is okay. Maybe Tomas Repik can look on that (-;</thetext>

Looks good, thanks for doing this.

Huh, I see the file just fine in fig2dev-3.2.6, anyways I&apos;ve checked and the patch is
already applied, so this is not a problem.

Thank you for taking care of the update.

Note f25 has already branched off. I&apos;ve merged the master branch into the f25 branch and started a build of transfig-3.2.6 there as well.</thetext>
