    <thetext>Description of problem:

First seen on Fedora-Xfce-Live-i386-24_Beta-1.3.iso before launching the installer.


Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
filesystem-3.2-37.fc24.i686
selinux-policy-3.13.1-182.fc24.noarch

How reproducible:
Each boot.


Steps to Reproduce:
1. Boot media.
2.
3.

Actual results:
SELinux is preventing accounts-daemon from write access on the directory root.

*****  Plugin catchall (100. confidence) suggests   **************************

If you believe that accounts-daemon should be allowed write access on the root directory by default.
Then you should report this as a bug.
You can generate a local policy module to allow this access.
Do
allow this access for now by executing:
# ausearch -c accounts-daemon --raw | audit2allow -M mypol
# semodule -i mypol.pp

accountsservice obviously doesn&apos;t need gvfs, so I pushed a change to disable gvfs.</thetext>

    <thetext>Chris: did you actually see a *notification* for this? I just tested with the 2016-05-31 nightly Workstation live, and if I run sealert I do see the AVC, but I did not get a desktop notification for it. The criterion explicitly talks about &quot;denial notifications or crash notifications&quot; for a reason - it is a polish criterion; the reason for the criterion is that it looks bad if we ship an image which tells the user something&apos;s wrong as soon as it starts up. So it&apos;s only really a release blocker if there&apos;s a *notification*.

As I didn&apos;t see one in my test, I&apos;d vote -1 blocker / +1 FE, but I&apos;ll change that vote if people say they see notifications (as the criterion says, &quot;on boot of or during installation from a release-blocking live image, or at first login after a default install&quot;).</thetext>

    <thetext>I&apos;ve been doing release validation testing against all the F24 spins and I hit this bug lots of times during the last 2/3 months.

I&apos;m pretty sure I have never seen a desktop notification for it (and that&apos;s why I had not proposed it).

So... I&apos;m -1 blocker and +1 FE.</thetext>

    <thetext>Odd. I wonder why no notification on it? Is the applet not notifying on _any_ avcs / not working?

Given the no notifications, I would be -1 blocker / +1 FE, but it would be good to know if the alerts are completely broken or it&apos;s just not mentioning anything about this specific avc for some reason.</thetext>

&gt; Odd. I wonder why no notification on it? Is the applet not notifying on
&gt; _any_ avcs / not working?

Correct, all notifications from sealert have been broken for some time now, at least in F24 and I think perhaps also in F23. So -1 blocker, +1 FE.</thetext>

    <thetext>yikes, that&apos;s not good. That in itself could arguably be a blocker as a violation of &quot;All applications that can be launched using the standard graphical mechanism of a release-blocking desktop after a default installation of that desktop must start successfully and withstand a basic functionality test.&quot; and/or &quot;All elements of the default panel (or equivalent) configuration in all release-blocking desktops must function correctly in typical use.&quot;, and I suppose if we *fixed* that, then this and other AVCs may suddenly start appearing as notifications and thus become blockers...</thetext>

    <thetext>Let&apos;s not fix notifications this late in the game; the app withstands a basic functionality test unless you happen to have prior knowledge that it is supposed to provide notifications. And I see two other AVCs in mine, so I guess we might wind up with even more blockers, indeed, if that&apos;s fixed.</thetext>

The avc denial is not visible as a DE notification. Plus the denial has no consequences insofar as this user is aware, it just seems like journal noise.</thetext>

    <thetext>This bug does not appear to meet the blocker criteria as there is no notification of the bug upon initial boot, and because of this, I vote -1 blocker. See the criteria here: [1]

It appears to me that comment 22 refutes the point made in comment 21 and proves that bug 1331926 is indeed a release-blocking bug.</thetext>

    <thetext>This bug was discussed at the 2016-06-06 blocker review meeting [1] and determined to be a RejectedBlocker as there is no automatic desktop notification displayed when this bug occurs and there are no significant practical consequences to this bug.

Installed F24 beta, then did a DNF update to the latest bits.  During the dnf update, I noticed two SELinux alerts.  This is one of the two.

    <thetext>Description of problem:
To reproduce
1 - Fresh Install of f24 beta from fedora official website (did not produce such notification)
2- dnf upgrade to get the latest bits
 =&gt; notification of two errors with SELinux

	a_ This one says &quot;SELinux is preventing accounts-daemon from write access on the directory root.&quot;
	b_ Another one says &quot;SELinux is preventing (uetoothd) from mounton access on the directory /etc.&quot;

{Note : the other error notification says &quot;uetoothd&quot; not sure if this is a mispelling of bluetoothd?}

I am fairly sure that the author of comment 26 has 1) -not- relabeled the file system after updating his system, 2) -not- deleted all pending SELinux alerts (probably stemming from the Beta state of his system before updating), and 3) -not- rebooted the system afterward which is the safest approach that SELinux alerts properly reflect the current policy.

If he had used a recent image like Fedora-Workstation-Live-x86_64-24-1.2.iso  instead of the completely outdated Beta image chances would have been good that he had had nothing to report; at least as far as the accountsservice alert is concerned.

I am currently using Fedora 24 Workstation RC2 even without testing updates, and no accountsservice alert is reported unlike recently.</thetext>

    <thetext>Well, isn&apos;t it simply that displaying of notifications for AVCs broke some time between Beta and now, so when you&apos;re running the Beta Shell code, you&apos;ll get notifications, but if you install from a current image, you don&apos;t?</thetext>

    <thetext>So today, I 

$ wget https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org//work/tasks/8107/14488107/Fedora-Workstation-Live-x86_64-24-1.2.iso

then dd&apos;d it and did an install.  I did get an accountsservice SELinux denial (in my audit log, not as a notification).  I checked the accountsservice version and it was accountsservice-0.6.40-3.fc24 (which doesn&apos;t have the fix).

I then did 

# yum update accountsservice --enablerepo=updates-testing

and blew away my audit log, then rebooted.  No more selinux denials.  I think this will be fixed as soon as the update gets pushed from testing.</thetext>

    <thetext>The difference in experience is simply down to whether display of notifications for AVCs is working or broken when you trigger the AVC, I think. Note that you installed RC-1.2, Jared and dzspam installed Beta.</thetext>

Dear Joachim
In answer to your assumptions, and in the spirit of contributing to a solution kindly find the below clarifications.
.
1_ Correct - I did not relabel the file system after applying updates/ not sure what that means, but I did not take any action after the update and before the error notifications appeared
.
2_ There were no visible SELinux error notifications prior to the update and the error notifications I reported happened immediately after dnf uppgrade
.
3_ Correct I reported the errors prior to rebooting i.e. immediately after they occurred
.
4_ Not quite sure. I had installed Fedora from the latest Live ISO  on June 14th available through the official website a few hours prior to the update at the following link https://getfedora.org/en/workstation/prerelease/
=&gt; not sure if the fedora website offered a completely outdated beta image or a release canditate material two days ago.
.
Thank you.</thetext>

This alert occurs once and only once after installing a system from Fedora-Workstation-Live-x86_64-24-1.2.iso without any further action taken. This can be verified by checking /var/log/audit/audit.log upon repeated reboots.
No updates, no relabeling of the file system are actually required in this case.</thetext>

That&apos;s strange.  The AVC should happen every boot until /root/.cache is created (and it won&apos;t get created if selinux is blocking it).  Granted I didn&apos;t verify the problem happens every boot. 

Could it be you logged in as root once, thus making /root/.cache get created?

Anyway, I&apos;m almost 100% sure this problem is fixed.</thetext>

    <thetext>well, no-one ever proposed it. it was only proposed as a blocker, and we didn&apos;t really think about FEing it when it was reviewed. it doesn&apos;t seem that important, as there&apos;s no visible notification anyhow.</thetext>

    <thetext>(In reply to Ray Strode [halfline] from comment #34)
As of accountsservice-0.6.40-3.fc24, the AVC is triggered during system start-up whenever accounts-daemon finds that /root/.cache/ does not exist and creates it. That is why this AVC is triggered every time you boot from the live media and exactly once after you boot into a freshly installed system. There is no need to log in as root. Since the denial is triggered before some user starts a desktop session, there is no notification in the GNOME Shell but the alert is reported in the &quot;SELinux Troubleshooter&quot; utility. The AVC can be triggered by deleting /root/.cache/ and rebooting the system.</thetext>

    <thetext>i don&apos;t understand how it&apos;s creating the directory if selinux is blocking it, but maybe the policy is half allowing the mkdir operation or something. i don&apos;t know, but it really doesn&apos;t matter. 

To be honest, this bug is really minor and was fixed weeks ago.  I think it&apos;s gotten far more discussion and far more of all of our time than it should have.  Let&apos;s just wait it out from here until the update goes through.

(dropping off cc, if anyone needs me, just ping me)</thetext>
