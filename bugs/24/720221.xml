How reproducible:
Tidy a html with Chinese output file name.

Steps to Reproduce:
By using the following command:
$ touch 中文.html
$ /usr/bin/tidy -f 中文.html.stderr -output 中文.html.stdout 中文.html
$ ls
中??!.html.stdout  中文.html  中文.html.stderr

  
Actual results:

    <thetext>This message is a notice that Fedora 15 is now at end of life. Fedora 
has stopped maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 15. It is 
Fedora&apos;s policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no 
longer maintained.  At this time, all open bugs with a Fedora &apos;version&apos;
of &apos;15&apos; have been closed as WONTFIX.

(Please note: Our normal process is to give advanced warning of this 
occurring, but we forgot to do that. A thousand apologies.)

Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you
plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, feel free to reopen 
this bug and simply change the &apos;version&apos; to a later Fedora version.

Bug Reporter: Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that 
we were unable to fix it before Fedora 15 reached end of life. If you 
would still like to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it 
against a later version of Fedora, you are encouraged to click on 
&quot;Clone This Bug&quot; (top right of this page) and open it against that 
version of Fedora.

Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release&apos;s 
lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events.  Often a 
more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes 
bugs or makes them obsolete.

The process we are following is described here:

    <thetext>This bug appears to have been reported against &apos;rawhide&apos; during the Fedora 19 development cycle.
Changing version to &apos;19&apos;.

(As we did not run this process for some time, it could affect also pre-Fedora 19 development
cycle bugs. We are very sorry. It will help us with cleanup during Fedora 19 End Of Life. Thank you.)
