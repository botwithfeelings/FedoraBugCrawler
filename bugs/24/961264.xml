    <thetext>There doesn&apos;t seem to be a simple way to track or control sssd&apos;s online status with regards to a domain. This leads to hacky solutions like as seen here:

https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA:Testcase_sssd_ad_dns_update

There should be a tool which can check sssd status of domains, and perform requests to be online/offline.

Name        : sssd
Arch        : x86_64
Version     : 1.10.0
Release     : 4.fc19.beta1

As seen on test day: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Test_Day:2013-05-09_SSSD_Improvements_and_AD_Integration</thetext>

    <thetext>SSSD has an undocumented feature for testing purposes that maybe we should make public. Sending any &apos;sssd_be&apos; process a SIGUSR2 will tell it to immediately attempt to establish a connection for that domain. Sending the &apos;sssd&apos; process a SIGUSR2 will tell it to make *all* configured domains try to go online.</thetext>

    <thetext>Actually, I correct that. It&apos;s right in the sssd(8) manpage:

SIGNALS
...
       SIGUSR1
           Tells the SSSD to simulate offline operation for one minute. This is mostly useful for testing purposes.

       SIGUSR2
           Tells the SSSD to go online immediately. This is mostly useful for testing purposes.</thetext>

&gt; indicator?

Yes, that would be great.

Perhaps, in addition, the same tool could send the appropriate unix signals to either one backend or to the sssd monitor, to make either one domain, or all domains go on/offline...</thetext>

&gt; &gt; What do we want know? If the SSSD is connected at the moment or not? That

&gt; &gt; indicator?
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, that would be great.
&gt; 

There is one inherent problem with such tool -- it would only be able to display the current status, but the next request might reset or change the status. SSSD is really designed to be reactive and change the status after each request.

Moreover, cached identity requests in particular can be returned from cache w/o even contacting the back end and having a chance to change the status while non-cached identity requests would reach the back end and make the SSSD go online/offline.

&gt; Perhaps, in addition, the same tool could send the appropriate unix signals
&gt; to either one backend or to the sssd monitor, to make either one domain, or
&gt; all domains go on/offline...

Yes, this sounds like upstream ticket #1800.</thetext>

    <thetext>This message is a notice that Fedora 19 is now at end of life. Fedora 
has stopped maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 19. It is 
Fedora&apos;s policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no 
longer maintained. Approximately 4 (four) weeks from now this bug will
be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora &apos;version&apos; of &apos;19&apos;.

Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you
plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the &apos;version&apos; 
to a later Fedora version.

Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not 
able to fix it before Fedora 19 is end of life. If you would still like 
to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version 
of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the &apos;version&apos; to a later Fedora 
version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.

Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release&apos;s 
lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a 
more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes 
bugs or makes them obsolete.</thetext>
