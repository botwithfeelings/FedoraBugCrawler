    <thetext>Please fix this ASAP, because keepassx 2.0.0 create databases which cannot be read by keepassx 0.4.4 which is an upgrade (WTF?!) in Fedora 24.

    <thetext>Discussed during the 2016-05-23 blocker review meeting: [1]

This bug has been classified as a RejectedBlocker and an AcceptedFreezeException as it is not in the release-blocking package sets in the blocker criteria, however there is a benefit to pushing this stable between the freeze date and 0-day update-push-day. See [2] for more info.

    <thetext>keepassx 2 on F23 (and F24 for a while) was a big mistake. The bug should be to downgrade keepassx to 0.4.4 on F23 instead.</thetext>

What about all those Fedora 23 users who cannot downgrade because KeePassX 2.0 has a DB which is incompatible with version 0.4.4? Not to mention that this DB cannot be exported and imported.

In short what you&apos;re saying is that we&apos;re all f*cked without explaining what&apos;s wrong with a newer version.</thetext>

&gt; this DB cannot be exported and imported.

Apparently the import into 2.0.0 creates a backup of the v1 DB file, which could still be used.

Also there is a fatal bug in 2.0.0 that is fixed in 2.0.1, so using 2.0.0 in F24 seems foolish. See https://www.keepassx.org/dev/issues/392</thetext>

It&apos;s foolish to force a new untested buggy version on Fedora users and then ... blame them for using it. It reeks of humiliation, arrogance and schadenfreude.

Update keepassx to 2.0.2 (v2.0.1 is also buggy) in both Fedora 23 and 24 and stop f*cking around.</thetext>

    <thetext>Proposed as a Freeze Exception for 24-final by Fedora user amluto using the blocker tracking app because:

 Without a fix for bug 1338054, KeePassX databases created on an up-to-date Fedora 23 system cannot be read on Fedora 24.

I propose that the following updates be allowed as freeze exceptions:

FEDORA-2016-78dd6d9bb7 - keepassx-2.0.2-1.fc24 (update keepassx on f24 so it is new enough to read databases created by f23&apos;s version)

FEDORA-2016-f1da178e94 - keepassx0-0.4.4-3.fc24 (allow users who want to stay on the 0.x series to do so)

Neither of these should have any effect on anything release-critical and therefore shouldn&apos;t impose any significant testing burden beyond simply testing the updates themselves.</thetext>

    <thetext>Shouldn&apos;t keepassx.fc24 provide /usr/bin/keepassx, though?  A symlink or an alternative would work.  IMO a symlink is more straightforward, since all the 2.0.0 users on fc23 expect it to live at /usr/bin/keepassx.</thetext>

&gt; See:
&gt; https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1340269
&gt; 
&gt; keepassx is going to 2.0.2 with a keepassx2 binary, and keepassx0 will
&gt; provide keepassx at 0.4.4.

This isn&apos;t correct.

keepassx2, as you submitted it, provides a &apos;/usr/bin/keepassx2&apos; binary.  keepassx0, as you submitted it, provides a &apos;/usr/bin/keepassx0&apos; binary.  Nothing provides /usr/bin/keepassx.

For keepassx0, see: http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/rpminfo?rpmID=7760707

If the fc23 mistake hadn&apos;t happened, then I think that having keepassx2 mean v2 and keepassx mean v0 would make sense.  But the mistake did happen, and I think that keepassx should run keepassx2.</thetext>

    <thetext>Please don&apos;t mess up the keepassx landscape in Fedora any further.

Updating keepassx to the &quot;2 series&quot; in F23 was a violation of packaging guidelines but happened. So, &quot;/usr/bin/keepassx&quot; being the series 2 binary is a matter of fact in the latest released Fedora.

Doing anything in F24 to revert that just adds more nuisances for keepassx users. Whoever didn&apos;t follow the move to series 2 has an &quot;excludes&quot; in their dnf config since then. Whoever made the move would be screwed by a F24 keepassx that is not what the F23 keepassx is, or newer.</thetext>

    <thetext>To clarify, I&apos;m doing what FESCO opted for.  This will be the result:

keepassx - 2.0.2 in Fedora(keepassx2), 0.4.4 in EPEL(keepassx).
keepassx0 - 0.x in Fedora(keepassx), not in EPEL.
keepassx2 - not in Fedora, 2.0.2 in EPEL(keepassx2).

We have Obsoletes in place that anyone with 0.4.4 should stay there.</thetext>

    <thetext>So, the question is what version should have the /usr/bin/keepassx name (if any). 

Right now, it&apos;s nothing, which seems... odd. Either the old one should keep that name (but then people won&apos;t be migrated until keepassx0 is dropped) or keepassx2 should have it (and people will migrate to the new one).</thetext>

    <thetext>Both keepassx-2.0.2-2.fc23 and keepassx0-0.4.4-3.fc23 have identical %description text, including:

 KeePassX uses a database format
 that is compatible with KeePass Password Safe for MS Windows.

but no mention that the database format is not compatible between the two. That seems like useful info to put in the %description, maybe something like:

 KeePassX uses a database format
 that is compatible with KeePass Password Safe v2 for MS Windows.

 KeePassX 0.4.x uses a database format
 that is compatible with KeePass Password Safe v1 for MS Windows.
