    <thetext>Description of problem:
Brasero is unable to burn any audio CD while K3B is working normally.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
brasero-3.12.1-3.fc23.x86_64


Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch brasero and start a new audio CD project
2. Try to burn

Actual results:
A dialog window appears with a status bar. Nothing else happens. The CD burner does not even move. The only way to exit brasero after that is to manually kill it.

Expected results:
Brasero should burn the CD like it did in the past.

Additional info:
K3B manages to burn audio CD on the same hardware.</thetext>

    <thetext>I&apos;m not sure if I even have any CDR&apos;s to test with but I&apos;ll take a look when I can. I&apos;m trying to keep Brasero going but development is basically stopped upstream.</thetext>

    <thetext>This message is a reminder that Fedora 23 is nearing its end of life.
Approximately 4 (four) weeks from now Fedora will stop maintaining
and issuing updates for Fedora 23. It is Fedora&apos;s policy to close all
bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time
this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora  &apos;version&apos;
of &apos;23&apos;.

Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you
plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the &apos;version&apos; 
to a later Fedora version.

Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not 
able to fix it before Fedora 23 is end of life. If you would still like 
to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version 
of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the &apos;version&apos; to a later Fedora 
version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.

Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release&apos;s 
lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a 
more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes 
bugs or makes them obsolete.</thetext>

    <thetext>What desktop are you using when you do this? I just tried on F24 and was able to save a .cue file without issue.</thetext>

    <thetext>Hello
Sorry I actually didn&apos;t do the test before changing the release version to F24...

I experienced this bug on F23, but now that I updated to F24, everything works back perfectly !</thetext>
