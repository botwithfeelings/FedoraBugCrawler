    <thetext>Description of problem:
In http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/bash.git/commit/bash-3.2-audit.patch?id=ac881ba83f94a4b96aadb41ac38a50f7e331b178 , bash-3.2-audit.patch lost the hunk calling the new code, making the patch completely ineffective.

From https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org//packages/bash/4.3.42/1.fc24/data/logs/x86_64/build.log :
&gt;readline.c:341:1: warning: &apos;audit_tty&apos; defined but not used [-Wunused-function]
&gt; audit_tty (char *string)

Similarly running bash under strace shows that no audit netlink sockets are created.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
bash-4.3.42-1.fc22.x86_64

How reproducible:
Always.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. See bug #1188695 comment #0, look specifically for USER_TTY records, see none.</thetext>

    <thetext>Yes, that patch is now wholly redundant, since that code is now in the upstream tarball, with the function residing under the name _rl_audit_tty.

As for netlink 
Please also notice this recent development spurred by one BZ and written by Steve Grubb https://osdir.com/ml/bug-bash-gnu/2015-09/msg00038.html. This should be in RHEL-7.3, though I&apos;ve not yet included it in Fedora.</thetext>

&gt; upstream tarball, with the function residing under the name _rl_audit_tty.

Honestly I don’t care which one is redundant with what, as long as it works ☺ and right now it seems not to.

&gt; As for netlink 
&gt; Please also notice this recent development spurred by one BZ and written by

If you are saying that that patch (https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-bash/2015-09/txtGLkevlqmgK.txt ) would make this work, that could very well be true. (But note that this again seems to reintroduce a separate audit_tty instead of using the one in readline; and FWIW the one in readline needs to work too.)</thetext>

    <thetext>The one in readline as a separate package? (Note bash isn&apos;t linked to readline as a library) That&apos;s out of my competence, but I&apos;ll apply Steve&apos;s patch in Fedora... for bash, I don&apos;t think it matters where the functionality comes from, does it?</thetext>

    <thetext>I was assuming that sharing Red Hat patches between the standalone and bash-included readline versions was saving you work; if it does not, feel free to ignore the standalone one.</thetext>

    <thetext>Fedora 22 changed to end-of-life (EOL) status on 2016-07-19. Fedora 22 is
no longer maintained, which means that it will not receive any further
security or bug fix updates. As a result we are closing this bug.

If you can reproduce this bug against a currently maintained version of
Fedora please feel free to reopen this bug against that version. If you
are unable to reopen this bug, please file a new report against the
current release. If you experience problems, please add a comment to this
bug.

Thank you for reporting this bug and we are sorry it could not be fixed.</thetext>

    <thetext>I&apos;m reopening this BZ, because this is something we should look into at some point.

Reason: Because of ownership transfer of bash that has happened this year, there was no time to look into all BZs properly...</thetext>

    <thetext>This was fixed by rebasing bash to version 4.4 in rawhide.</thetext>
