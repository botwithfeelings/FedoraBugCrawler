    <thetext>What were you doing when you got this? What&apos;s the full error?

Anyway: the current Fedora sos packages are quite out of date and the versions in different streams are a bit of a mess.

We&apos;d been planning to release 3.3 upstream in late Summer and update all Fedora builds simultaneously however we&apos;re running a bit late on the release as we work on improved OpenStack and other plugin support.

As we&apos;re going to be a bit longer getting 3.3 out I&apos;m planning to push an update to all the supported Fedora releases and Rawhide this week that will bring them up to a more recent 3.2 based build (3.2-15 is quite old now and some releases still have 3.2 alpha packages).</thetext>

    <thetext>We&apos;ve just made a (very overdue) 3.3 release upstream. I&apos;ll try to get the Fedora packages updated this week or next.

We don&apos;t currently have someone looking after the package regularly in Fedora - I&apos;ll bring that up with the others who work on the package to see if we can take care of this better in future.</thetext>

    <thetext>Hi, the problem is not about releasing 3.3 really, it&apos;s about -15 being built and pushed before -1 and -2. Releasing 3.3 will fix it though since 3.3-1 is newer than both 3.2-2 and 3.2-15.</thetext>

    <thetext>Yes I understand that; the point is that we&apos;ve been busy getting that release out (sos is shipped in many more distributions than just Fedora and RHEL) and as a result Fedora maintenance is behind.

Right now only one person updates the package and they also have other full-time commitments.

3.3 will go to rawhide first and 24 will be updated to the current 3.2 build; assuming all is well with 3.3 another update will follow shortly to bring all the supported releases into sync.</thetext>

    <thetext>Sounds good - for F24 and below I would recommend bumping the RPM Release value to 20 so that NEVR order is restored.</thetext>

    <thetext>&gt; -15 being built and pushed before -1 and -2.

That was an error when the package was updated for f22; it wouldn&apos;t have mattered if the release numbers had been continued but the update was not pushed to rawhide also as it should have been.

F22 is nearing EOL now anyway so it doesn&apos;t seem worth trying to go back and correct this for all 3.2 builds; the new 3.3 version will supersede all of these anyway and we&apos;ll be able to re-start on a clean release number.

Sorry for the update pain and we&apos;ll try to get this straightened out asap.</thetext>

    <thetext>It is true t hat F22 is about to be EOL soon. However, F23 and F24 are currently still older for RMPthan 3.2-15.fc22, which leads to confusion when upgrading.
As you are planning to update the packages anyway, please just make sure that the release value is high enough. Workload-wise it not matter if 3.2-2 is followed by 3.2-3 or 3.2-16, but the latter does fix the problem while the former does not.</thetext>

    <thetext>This message is a reminder that Fedora 23 is nearing its end of life.
Approximately 4 (four) weeks from now Fedora will stop maintaining
and issuing updates for Fedora 23. It is Fedora&apos;s policy to close all
bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time
this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora  &apos;version&apos;
of &apos;23&apos;.

Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you
plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the &apos;version&apos; 
to a later Fedora version.

Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not 
able to fix it before Fedora 23 is end of life. If you would still like 
to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version 
of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the &apos;version&apos; to a later Fedora 
version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.

Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release&apos;s 
lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a 
more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes 
bugs or makes them obsolete.</thetext>
