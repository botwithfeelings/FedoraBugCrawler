    <thetext>Hello , 
I saw ark package code of Fedora [1] and have one, not official, patch to support unar (the Unarchiver) and the only reference that I found is here [2]. 
Checking differences between patches upstream, I saw last patches deletes the comment  03 - cannot edit archives. So the authors seems already know that preview doesn&apos;t work (for unar) and we don&apos;t have any solution for this bug.

    <thetext>This message is a reminder that Fedora 21 is nearing its end of life.
Approximately 4 (four) weeks from now Fedora will stop maintaining
and issuing updates for Fedora 21. It is Fedora&apos;s policy to close all
bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time
this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora  &apos;version&apos;
of &apos;21&apos;.

Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you
plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the &apos;version&apos; 
to a later Fedora version.

Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not 
able to fix it before Fedora 21 is end of life. If you would still like 
to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version 
of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the &apos;version&apos; to a later Fedora 
version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.

Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release&apos;s 
lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a 
more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes 
bugs or makes them obsolete.</thetext>

    <thetext>ark-16.04 adopted proper unar support, we&apos;ll see if preview works then or not.  (If not, then this is best addressed upstream @ bugs.kde.org, not here)</thetext>
