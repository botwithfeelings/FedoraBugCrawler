<thetext>Description of problem: yum/dnf glitch detected. Apparently spin can install an application from a repo that never gets installed or copied. So happens(will have to respin to fix) that chromium got installed from fedora-chromium-stable(which
has been known to trigger libusbx issues. SPOT is preferred..) but the repo never made it. I thought it was a menu glitch as the &apos;users and groups&apos; app somehow never got installed but the menu was there. Chromium is indeed installed.But
theres no repo for it. Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): 22 How reproducible: post spin apparently Steps to Reproduce: 1.spin fedora 2.install spun fedora 3.check your menu Actual results: ?? Expected results: The package
should not have been installed but this indicates the other issue: The repo never got copied over, but was used for the spin and installation.</thetext>

<thetext>Fedora 22 changed to end-of-life (EOL) status on 2016-07-19. Fedora 22 is no longer maintained, which means that it will not receive any further security or bug fix updates. As a result we are closing this bug. If you can reproduce this bug
against a currently maintained version of Fedora please feel free to reopen this bug against that version. If you are unable to reopen this bug, please file a new report against the current release. If you experience problems, please add a comment to
this bug. Thank you for reporting this bug and we are sorry it could not be fixed.</thetext>

<thetext>How can you not know when your dev ing fedora how not to spin fedora? koji builds are spun you nitwit. Im just adding more to it. If you dont know what a kickstart is,or how to use it, dont reply. that said: yes, im adding in rpmfusion,
however..repo are getting used for spin the iso of fedora to pull packages from however, the repo never gets installed after the iso is installed to a hard disk. The apps get pulled and installed apparently from &apos;nowhere&apos;. at the least we
need the repo data copied into the installed linux somehow but this isnt happening. should still work for 24.</thetext>

<thetext>(In reply to Richard Jasmin from comment #4) &gt; How can you not know when your dev ing fedora how not to spin fedora? koji &gt; builds are spun you nitwit. Im just adding more to it. &gt; &gt; If you dont know what a kickstart is,or how to

work for 24. most probably lorax or pungi. but without detailed information, logs and etc. it&apos;s not going to be fixed.</thetext>
