<thetext>Description of problem: gnome-vfs2 is deprecated in favor of gvfs. Please add that to package description to help users and devs to figure out which package (gvfs) to install. GnomeVFS is not used any more by nautilus. Version-Release number
of selected component (if applicable): 2.24.4-19.fc23.x86_64 How reproducible: always, see spec file Furthermore there should probably be a plan to remove gnome-vfs2 from Fedora, since it hasn&apos;t seen any security updates but does network and
crypto related stuff.</thetext>

<thetext>This message is a reminder that Fedora 23 is nearing its end of life. Approximately 4 (four) weeks from now Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 23. It is Fedora&apos;s policy to close all bug reports from releases
that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora &apos;version&apos; of &apos;23&apos;. Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently
maintained version, simply change the &apos;version&apos; to a later Fedora version. Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not able to fix it before Fedora 23 is end of life. If you would still like to see this bug fixed
and are able to reproduce it against a later version of Fedora, you are encouraged change the &apos;version&apos; to a later Fedora version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above. Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible
during every release&apos;s lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes bugs or makes them obsolete.</thetext>
