Does anything happen with these &quot;Upstream Release Monitoring&quot; tickets?

As this ticket says, 0.0.40 of vagrant-libvirt is out.  Can we get updated packages for Fedora 25?

&gt; Does anything happen with these &quot;Upstream Release Monitoring&quot; tickets?

Of course they are resolved from time to time

&gt; As this ticket says, 0.0.40 of vagrant-libvirt is out.  Can we get updated
&gt; packages for Fedora 25?

I don&apos;t typically update stable versions, unless there is specific reason. So could you please elaborate why F25 should be updated? Thx

--- Additional comment from Brian J. Murrell on 2017-06-15 09:00:11 EDT ---

Because 0.0.40 has additional useful features such as:

https://github.com/vagrant-libvirt/vagrant-libvirt/commit/d78d8969098bbe466d8381a90914a799bb563485

Undoubtedly it has bug fixes in it also.

--- Additional comment from Brian J. Murrell on 2017-06-15 10:15:53 EDT ---

And https://github.com/vagrant-libvirt/vagrant-libvirt/commit/59edda86239b4b33d24f809177c4bc7e3036307a

--- Additional comment from Vít Ondruch on 2017-06-16 04:41:05 EDT ---

Thx for elaborating. The former was already part of 0.0.36 while the later is not released yet I am afraid. But I&apos;ll consider the update.

--- Additional comment from Brian J. Murrell on 2017-06-16 07:24:54 EDT ---

Alternatively, both patches backport rather easily.  I can attach the backported patches here if you like, since I have already rolled my own 0.0.35 + those two patches and those two features are working just fine.

vondruch&apos;s vagrant-libvirt-0.0.40-1.fc27 completed http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=909809

I rebased vagrant-libvirt in Rawhide, therefore I&apos;m going to close this ticket now. It would be nice if you could open separate ticket for the backports you are referencing above. Thx.
