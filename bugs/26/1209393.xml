    <thetext>Description of problem:
When I tired to install package downloaded from koji, that was for wrong architecture (happens occasionally), dnf is issuing really not helpful error message. Running deprecated yum helped me on the first sight. I would like to have dnf as helpful as yum.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
dnf-0.6.5-1.fc23.noarch
yum-3.4.3-505.fc23.noarch

How reproducible:
deterministic

Steps to Reproduce:
# dnf install fwknop-2.6.5-1.fc23.x86_64.rpm
[...]
Error: package fwknop-2.6.5-1.fc23.x86_64 is not installable

# yum-deprecated install fwknop-2.6.5-1.fc23.x86_64.rpm
[...]
Cannot add package fwknop-2.6.5-1.fc23.x86_64.rpm to transaction. Not a compatible architecture: x86_64
Error: Nothing to do

Actual results:
general message that package is not installable.

Expected results:
more specific message with clue what is actually wrong.</thetext>

    <thetext>This bug appears to have been reported against &apos;rawhide&apos; during the Fedora 23 development cycle.
Changing version to &apos;23&apos;.

(As we did not run this process for some time, it could affect also pre-Fedora 23 development
cycle bugs. We are very sorry. It will help us with cleanup during Fedora 23 End Of Life. Thank you.)

    <thetext>This message is a reminder that Fedora 23 is nearing its end of life.
Approximately 4 (four) weeks from now Fedora will stop maintaining
and issuing updates for Fedora 23. It is Fedora&apos;s policy to close all
bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time
this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora  &apos;version&apos;
of &apos;23&apos;.

Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you
plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the &apos;version&apos; 
to a later Fedora version.

Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not 
able to fix it before Fedora 23 is end of life. If you would still like 
to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version 
of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the &apos;version&apos; to a later Fedora 
version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.

Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release&apos;s 
lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a 
more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes 
bugs or makes them obsolete.</thetext>
