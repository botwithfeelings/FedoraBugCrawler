&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; # dnf check all
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No such command: check. Please use /bin/dnf --help
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It could be a DNF plugin command, try: &quot;dnf install
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &apos;dnf-command(check)&apos;&quot;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Any idea how to make it smarter without a need to (re)download metadata?
&gt; 
&gt; Sure — a core plugin could know about deprecated yum commands and print
&gt; the alternative. Or better, for _at least_ everything listed in the yum
&gt; man page where there&apos;s an obvious mapping, just do it (even if those
&gt; things stay documented as compatibility options).</thetext>

    <thetext>I think we can implement it as plugins provided by the dnf-yum subpackage. I&apos;d start with just printing a message and in case of a significant demand, we can consider calling the DNF alternatives directly. One drawback is e.g. that the commands are not part of the dnf package and thus we would have to either Require both dnf-plugins-core and dnf-plugins-extras or make it work just in case they are installed.</thetext>

    <thetext>This bug appears to have been reported against &apos;rawhide&apos; during the Fedora 23 development cycle.
Changing version to &apos;23&apos;.

(As we did not run this process for some time, it could affect also pre-Fedora 23 development
cycle bugs. We are very sorry. It will help us with cleanup during Fedora 23 End Of Life. Thank you.)

    <thetext>This message is a reminder that Fedora 23 is nearing its end of life.
Approximately 4 (four) weeks from now Fedora will stop maintaining
and issuing updates for Fedora 23. It is Fedora&apos;s policy to close all
bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time
this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora  &apos;version&apos;
of &apos;23&apos;.

Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you
plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the &apos;version&apos; 
to a later Fedora version.

Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not 
able to fix it before Fedora 23 is end of life. If you would still like 
to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version 
of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the &apos;version&apos; to a later Fedora 
version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.

Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release&apos;s 
lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a 
more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes 
bugs or makes them obsolete.</thetext>
