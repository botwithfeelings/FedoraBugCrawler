    <thetext>For some reason, the &apos;custodia&apos; package is entirely missing from the Fedora 26 Final RC-1.3 compose:

https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org/compose/26/Fedora-26-20170702.0/compose/Everything/x86_64/os/Packages/c/

Check the package list there for a &apos;custodia&apos; package, you will find none. Now compare to the nightly of the same date:

https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org/compose/branched/Fedora-26-20170702.n.0/compose/Everything/x86_64/os/Packages/c/

and you will see there *is* a custodia package present, custodia-0.3.1-2.fc26.noarch.rpm , which was a part of this update:

https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2017-0d0ec3e0af

which was pushed stable a month ago. I do not know why the package is missing from the RC-1.3 compose, but it is a clear criteria violation unfortunately, as it renders FreeIPA (at least server, I believe also client) entirely impossible to install, as freeipa-server-common requires custodia:

2017-07-02T15:25:48Z WARNING 
 Problem 1: package freeipa-server-4.4.4-2.fc26.x86_64 requires freeipa-server-common = 4.4.4-2.fc26, but none of the providers can be installed
  - conflicting requests
  - nothing provides custodia &gt;= 0.3.1 needed by freeipa-server-common-4.4.4-2.fc26.noarch
 Problem 2: package freeipa-server-dns-4.4.4-2.fc26.noarch requires freeipa-server = 4.4.4-2.fc26, but none of the providers can be installed
  - package freeipa-server-4.4.4-2.fc26.x86_64 requires freeipa-server-common = 4.4.4-2.fc26, but none of the providers can be installed

We urgently need to do an RC-1.4 compose with this fixed.</thetext>

    <thetext>Clearly a blocker. I&apos;m also concerned that other packages may be dropped and we just happened to notice this one because it blocks something needed for a specific Server role.</thetext>

    <thetext>Matthew: yes, I agree on that - I&apos;d like, if possible, for releng to explain why custodia was missing and check whether anything else was affected similarly.</thetext>

&gt; Matthew: yes, I agree on that - I&apos;d like, if possible, for releng to explain
&gt; why custodia was missing and check whether anything else was affected
&gt; similarly.

Got this in IRC:

[04:10:08] &lt;tyll_&gt; adamw: mboddu: Sorry about custodia, I wrongly blocked it when cleaning up broken deps :-/ I skipped python-etcd for freeipa but missed that custodia was still on the list as an intermediate dependency

Related ticket is https://pagure.io/releng/issue/6836, and I *think* we&apos;re all okay.</thetext>

    <thetext>Discussed at 2017-07-03 blocker review meeting: https://meetbot-raw.fedoraproject.org/fedora-blocker-review/2017-07-03/f26-blocker-review.2017-07-03-16.06.html . Accepted as a blocker bug as a clear violation of Alpha criterion &quot;Release-blocking roles and the supported role configuration interfaces must meet the core functional Role Definition Requirements to the extent that supported roles can be successfully deployed, started, stopped, brought to a working configuration, and queried.&quot;

For the record, we are unblocking all packages which were blocked from RC-1.1 and RC-1.3 due to dependency issues, on the basis this happened far too late and could have unpredictable effects we do not have time to exhaustively investigate: see https://pagure.io/releng/issue/6836 for more on that. Marking as MODIFIED as I believe mboddu already unblocked custodia in preparation for the next compose.</thetext>

    <thetext>Fix confirmed in RC-1.4, the openQA test passed, so the package is certainly back.</thetext>
