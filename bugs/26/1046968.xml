    <thetext>After upgrading to F20, there&apos;s an excessive boot delay. systemd-analyze blame points the finger to:

[root@monster ~]# systemd-analyze blame
         43.747s innd-expire.service
         18.325s console-kit-log-system-start.service
          8.540s network.service
          6.889s yum-updatesd.service
          5.372s httpd.service
...

It seems that the multi-user target wants innd-expire.service, which executes &quot;/usr/libexec/news/news.daily delayrm&quot;.

I did not have the same issue in F19. I do not recall whether F19&apos;s inn ran news.daily, or not, at startup. But this doesn&apos;t really appear to be necessary, to pause the entire system boot until inn finishes expiring old articles.

If it&apos;s absolutely necessary to kick off news.daily at system boot, that seems to be something that can continue running, at low priorty, while the rest of the system continues booting.</thetext>

    <thetext>This message is a reminder that Fedora 20 is nearing its end of life.
Approximately 4 (four) weeks from now Fedora will stop maintaining
and issuing updates for Fedora 20. It is Fedora&apos;s policy to close all
bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time
this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora  &apos;version&apos;
of &apos;20&apos;.

Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you
plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the &apos;version&apos; 
to a later Fedora version.

Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not 
able to fix it before Fedora 20 is end of life. If you would still like 
to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version 
of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the &apos;version&apos; to a later Fedora 
version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.

Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release&apos;s 
lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a 
more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes 
bugs or makes them obsolete.</thetext>

    <thetext>This bug appears to have been reported against &apos;rawhide&apos; during the Fedora 23 development cycle.
Changing version to &apos;23&apos;.

(As we did not run this process for some time, it could affect also pre-Fedora 23 development
cycle bugs. We are very sorry. It will help us with cleanup during Fedora 23 End Of Life. Thank you.)

    <thetext>Actually, I believe this was fixed back in 2013, a few days after being reported. Please reopen if it&apos;s still an issue (the OnBootSec=3min might be too short).</thetext>
