    <thetext>Description of problem:

I need to install an older kernel that was removed during an update. However, using dnf install  gives:

~&gt; sudo dnf install kernel-3.17.4-301.fc21
Error: conflicting requests

Running yum install kernel-3.17.4-301.fc21 installed the kernel without any problems.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):

~&gt; dnf --version
0.6.3
  Installed: dnf-0:0.6.3-2.fc21.noarch at 2014-12-20 16:30
  Built    : Fedora Project at 2014-12-09 13:51


How reproducible:

Every time I run dnf install

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make sure that on Fedora 21 all updates are applied and reboot with the latest kernel.
2. Run dnf remove kernel-3.17.4-301.fc21 to make sure that the older kernel is removed.
3. Install it using dnf install kernel-3.17.4-301.fc21

Actual results:
Error: conflicting requests

Expected results:
The older kernel is installed.</thetext>

    <thetext>This message is a reminder that Fedora 21 is nearing its end of life.
Approximately 4 (four) weeks from now Fedora will stop maintaining
and issuing updates for Fedora 21. It is Fedora&apos;s policy to close all
bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time
this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora  &apos;version&apos;
of &apos;21&apos;.

Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you
plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the &apos;version&apos; 
to a later Fedora version.

Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not 
able to fix it before Fedora 21 is end of life. If you would still like 
to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version 
of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the &apos;version&apos; to a later Fedora 
version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.

Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release&apos;s 
lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a 
more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes 
bugs or makes them obsolete.</thetext>

    <thetext>Fedora 21 changed to end-of-life (EOL) status on 2015-12-01. Fedora 21 is
no longer maintained, which means that it will not receive any further
security or bug fix updates. As a result we are closing this bug.

If you can reproduce this bug against a currently maintained version of
Fedora please feel free to reopen this bug against that version. If you
are unable to reopen this bug, please file a new report against the
current release. If you experience problems, please add a comment to this
bug.

Thank you for reporting this bug and we are sorry it could not be fixed.</thetext>

    <thetext>I have the same issue on fedora 24.
And if we use &apos;yum-deprecated&apos; (I do not know if this command can cause problems) to install an older kernel, the latest kernel is removed [1]. 
So this is not a workaround.
