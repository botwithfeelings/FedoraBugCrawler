    <thetext>Description of problem:
P11-kit cannot be used by applications such as apache which are under a strict SELinux policy which prevents executable+writable memory.

That is, because it relies on libffi, which uses a temp file to mmap memory for execution, and that&apos;s blocked by SELinux&apos;s policy. I find the policy of blocking execution in tmp quite reasonable, so I think that libffi and p11-kit are to blame here.

That issue is not there when SELinux is set to not enforcing. The
SELinux warning is:

&quot;SELinux is preventing /usr/sbin/httpd from execute access on the file
/tmp/ffisox7RN (deleted).&quot;


Possible solutions were discussed in the upstream thread at:

    <thetext>&gt; P11-kit cannot be used by applications such as apache which are under a strict SELinux policy which prevents executable+writable memory.

Such applications can currently use the P11_KIT_UNMANAGED module loading option. This disables many of the features of p11-kit ... but that&apos;s to be expected, since those features are enabled by the closure support in libffi.</thetext>

    <thetext>The problem is that the applications don&apos;t even know they are using p11-kit. The way we go with transparent PKCS #11 support (in gnutls or engine_pkcs11) means that applications can&apos;t switch to unmanaged.

For engine_pkcs11 it is even worse because it relies on the proxy module which requires libffi.</thetext>

    <thetext>Could the proxying be done out-of-process? Split the proxy module and call the real modules in a different process which would also solve the isolated keys problem.</thetext>

&gt; the real modules in a different process which would also solve the isolated
&gt; keys problem.

Yes that could be a possible solution.</thetext>

    <thetext>One of the reasons we use libffi clusures is remoting PKCS#11. Hence I don&apos;t think that would be an easy solution.

We should probably just break down and manually build in a fixed set of compiled closures into the p11-kit library that we can use generating closures dymanically with libffi fails.</thetext>

    <thetext>Another solution which is relevant for the apache/nginx use case, is having the proxy module in unmanaged mode if managed mode cannot be initialized. In these use-cases we don&apos;t have multiple consumers of PKCS #11 to care about managed mode.

That would also be a solution for mod_gnutls. If p11-kit cannot initialize the modules in managed mode and switches to unmanaged mode it would work.

That would effectively allow the operation of p11-kit without libffi.</thetext>

    <thetext>Well, in p11-kit we have the concept of &apos;enable-in&apos; and &apos;disable-in&apos; These are configuration settings that only apply for certain processes. In theory we could have a mode where all modules are unmanaged in a given process, if so configured.

This is yet another solution to the problem, for you to consider.</thetext>
