<thetext>Description of problem: rpmlint appears to be interpreting development (-devel) packages incorrectly. It always produces the only-non-binary-in-usr-lib warning, which does not appear to be a valid warning for the development packages. Either
that, or many packages in Fedora are a bit broken. At least the following binary packages produce this warning. Surely they cannot all be wrong. cpl-6.4.2-2.fc21.x86_64.rpm cfitsio-devel-3.370-3.fc21.x86_64.rpm fftw-devel-3.3.4-5.fc21.x86_64.rpm
gsl-devel-1.16-15.fc21.x86_64.rpm libpng-devel-1.6.10-3.fc21.x86_64.rpm perl-devel-5.18.4-308.fc21.x86_64.rpm wcslib-devel-4.23-3.fc21.x86_64.rpm Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): Fedora 21. But I think this happens on 22
also. How reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Download one of the -devel packages mentioned above. (e.g. cpl-devel-6.4.2-2.fc21.x86_64.rpm) 2. Run the rpmlint command on the package file. Actual results: $ rpmlint
cpl-devel-6.4.2-2.fc21.x86_64.rpm cpl-devel.x86_64: W: only-non-binary-in-usr-lib 1 packages and 0 specfiles checked; 0 errors, 1 warnings. Expected results: $ rpmlint cpl-devel-6.4.2-2.fc21.x86_64.rpm 1 packages and 0 specfiles checked; 0 errors, 0
warnings.</thetext>

<thetext>This message is a reminder that Fedora 21 is nearing its end of life. Approximately 4 (four) weeks from now Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 21. It is Fedora&apos;s policy to close all bug reports from releases
that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora &apos;version&apos; of &apos;21&apos;. Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently
maintained version, simply change the &apos;version&apos; to a later Fedora version. Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not able to fix it before Fedora 21 is end of life. If you would still like to see this bug fixed
and are able to reproduce it against a later version of Fedora, you are encouraged change the &apos;version&apos; to a later Fedora version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above. Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible
during every release&apos;s lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes bugs or makes them obsolete.</thetext>

<thetext>Fedora 22 changed to end-of-life (EOL) status on 2016-07-19. Fedora 22 is no longer maintained, which means that it will not receive any further security or bug fix updates. As a result we are closing this bug. If you can reproduce this bug
against a currently maintained version of Fedora please feel free to reopen this bug against that version. If you are unable to reopen this bug, please file a new report against the current release. If you experience problems, please add a comment to
this bug. Thank you for reporting this bug and we are sorry it could not be fixed.</thetext>

<thetext>There&apos;s no sensible way to whitelist/blacklist this that I can see. Just bask in the knowledge that you&apos;re smarter than the lint tool in this instance. :)</thetext>
